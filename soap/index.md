# Introduction

The ePages SOAP API is a central data interface to exchange data between ePages and external systems or software applications.
It is based on web services, which include SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Definition Language), and the XSD (XML Schema Definition) language.
You can use the SOAP API with any programming language that supports web services.

Making use of the web services, you can manage your shops by providing calls for working with resources such as customers, categories, products or orders.
Web services also allow you to manage shopping carts and inventory as well as receiving general shop information.

To successfully work with the web services, profound knowledge in software development and web services is required.

# Using the web services

Access to the web services is only enabled for the shop types ePages Flex or ePages Enterprise.
ePages will provide the credentials to use the web services. Read further [here](page:soap-access).
