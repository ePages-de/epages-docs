The general section about [creating an app](page:apps-create) explains some of the concepts and the basic workflow required to develop an app.
We also take care of the most crucial part, the [OAuth 2.0 token exchange](page:apps-install).

With this tutorial, we are going into more detail and explain exactly how you can implement all this in practice.
We are using PHP, but the functionality is very simple and can easily be implemented with any other coding language.

You will see how the OAuth 2.0 exchange is done to get your access token and how you can use it to make API calls.

## Prerequisites

In order to get this code working, you need to setup your development environment:

* PHP 5.2+
* publicly reachable server

### Sign up for an ePages test shop

Simply sign up [here](http://www.epages.cloud/developer/) for a free account.

### Create a developer app

In order to create an app, to test it and to submit it to the App & Theme Store, you have to create a developer app.

Go to the **Developer apps** view on the tab **Apps & Themes** and [create a new developer app](page:apps-create) by clicking **Add**.

After choosing a name to your liking, you need to set the **Application Callback URL** to your publicly available PHP script (e.g. `https://crazytoppingapp.com/callback.php`), which we will implement later.

{% callout info Note: %}
We allow HTTP Application Callback URLs for developer apps, but you need to provide an HTTPS URL once you want to submit the app to the App & Theme Store.
{% endcallout %}

Once you are done with that, the detail page will show your client credentials.

As you can see, there is no **Access token** right away.
You have to go through the [installation process](page:apps-install) first to acquire one.

The **Test authorisation** button basically simulates an installation by a user - in this case yourself.
After the token exchange is done, you will receive an **Access token**, which will also be displayed on this page.

{% callout info Note: %}
Any subsequent calls will uninstall the app and reinitiate the installation process, which will result in a new access token (and invalidation of the old access token).
{% endcallout %}

## Getting an access token

For a more general overview of the installation process and the OAuth 2.0 token exchange, we recommend you to read though the [installation process](page:apps-install) first.

Now that everything is in place, we can actually start coding.
We will create the mentioned `callback.php` file, which will be called when a user installs an app.

### Setting credentials

The first thing we will do is set the **client credentials** (`client_id` and `client_secret`) you got from the developer app detail page.

    <?php

    $client_id     = '0BE38CFF-F3B6-4D68-8F16-1CE270C028BC';
    $client_secret = 'DkRUi6uo6KzglHmwOhFkVYNhcumCTOlP';

### Listen for callback

Next, you need to listen for a request to get the `authorization_code`, which you can exchange for an access token.
The call, which you can trigger with the **Test authorisation** button, will look like this:

https://crazytoppingapp.com/callback.php?code=*{authorization_code}*&access_token_url=*{access_token_url}*&api_url=*{api_url}*

You need to extract the `code`, `access_token_url` and `api_url` to use later on.
We also send the `return_url` to redirect the user back to, as soon as he is done with the registration and installation.

    $code             = $_GET["code"];
    $access_token_url = $_GET["access_token_url"];
    $api_url          = $_GET["api_url"];

{% callout warning Note: %}
In a production environment, you would use the `api_url` as the unique identifier for the merchant.
You will also use it as the base URL for REST calls.
{% endcallout %}

### Exchange authorisation code for access token

Now we need to exchange the **authorisation code** for the access token.
We will create a function called `get_token()`, which will need the **client credentials**, the `access_token_url` and the `code` and will just print the `access_token` as a response.

    $access_token = get_token($access_token_url, $client_id, $client_secret, $code);
    echo $access_token;

{% callout info Note: %}
In a production environment, you would not disclose the **Access token** to anyone, not even the merchant.
This token (depending on the scopes) has access to the merchants shop and is directly associated to your app.
{% endcallout %}

Next, we need to actually implement the `get_token()` function.
In this function we need to:

- encode the **client credentials** and `code` as `x-www-form-urlencoded`,
- pass them as a `POST` request to the `access_token_url` and
- parse the JSON response containing a single `access_token` value.

The encoded `client_id`, `client_secret` and `code` are assigned to `$post_content`.

After that, we set the necessary request options for `curl`:

- the URL,
- the HTTP method,
- the Content-Type-Header and the
- request body.

After a successful request, we receive a JSON-encoded response and return the extracted **Access token**.

    function get_token($url, $client_id, $client_secret, $code)
    {
        // request body
        $post_content = http_build_query(array(
            'code' => $code,
            'client_id' => $client_id,
            'client_secret' => $client_secret
        ));

        // curl options
        $curl_options = array(
            CURLOPT_URL => $url,
            CURLOPT_POST => 1,
            CURLOPT_HEADER => "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
            CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $post_content,
            CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => TRUE
        );

        // curl request
        $curl = curl_init();
        curl_setopt_array($curl, $curl_options);
        $result = curl_exec($curl);
        curl_close($curl);
        return json_decode(utf8_encode($result))->{access_token};
    }
    ?>

## Use the API

After you have successfully received the access token, you can use it to make requests to the API.
You construct the available resource URL by taking the `api_url` and appending the resource you want to call.

If you want to list the products, you can make a simple `GET` request to the **products** endpoint.
We are using the command line tool `curl` in this example:

    curl -XGET {api_url}/products
         -H 'Accept: application/vnd.epages.v1+json'
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'

The response will look something like this:

    {
      "results": 1,
      "page": 1,
      "resultsPerPage": 10,
      "items": [
        {
          "productId": "55BB92D1-DE61-A290-24CD-7F000101F96C",
          "name": "Berghaus Paclite Jacket - Men",
          "shortDescription": "Weatherproof. Small pack size. Ultra light.",
          "description": "Weatherproof and compact. Ultra light.",
          "images": [
            {
              "url": "http://gecko/WebRoot/Store/Shops/DemoShop/Products/be_40401/be_40401_blue.jpg",
              "classifier": "Large"
            },
            ...
          ],
          "priceInfo": {
            ...
          },
          "forSale": false,
          "specialOffer": false,
            ...
          ]
        },
      ]
    }
