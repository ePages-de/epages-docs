# RESTful API

It's very easy to build and test applications with our API, since it is based on RESTful principles.
The API uses the standard HTTP request types `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

# Your benefits

In order to meet individual requirements, we offer a flexible revenue share plan with the possibility to gain up to 70% of the total revenue generated through the App & Theme Store, depending on the use case of your application and business model.
After your application has been submitted to us, our partner management will get back to you for a final partner and revenue agreement.

Have questions? If you would like further details related to the partner conditions, feel free to contact us at [apps@epages.com](mailto:apps@epages.com).
Please provide us with a short specification of your business model and define precisely the use cases of your app.
