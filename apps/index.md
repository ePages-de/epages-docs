## Introduction {#introduction}

The ePages API is based on RESTful principles, allowing you to code in whatever language you prefer.
It supports JSON media types and uses UTF-8 character encoding.
The API uses the standard HTTP request types `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

Making use of this API, you can create awesome apps or single shop connections.
It is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within ePages shops.
With a standard interface to store data, it is very simple to create applications that can communicate with our merchant's shops.

In a first approach, we support 3rd party applications that connect via the REST API to ePages shops, allowing them to exchange data and allowing the merchant to work with these data.

## Registration {#registration}

Put your idea into action!
Before you can start coding away, you'll need to sign up for the ePages Developer Program and create a test shop.
To use the ePages API you will need an application registration.
Once submitted successfully, your app will be available to more than 140,000 online shop owners in the [ePages App Store](https://blog.epages.com/us/2016/05/14/the-epages-app-store-everything-for-your-e-commerce-success/).
