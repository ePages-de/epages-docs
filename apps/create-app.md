title: Create an app

Once you have your test shop in place, you can create an app.
Oh, by the way, this is the API URL for your test shop: `https://devshop.epages.com/rs/shops/{shopId}`.

You automatically receive a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret** when you create an app in your test shop.
After successful authorisation of your app, you will be assigned an **Access token**.

| Value              | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Client&nbsp;ID**      | The unique identifier for your app. |
| **Client&nbsp;Secret**   | Used in combination with the **Client ID** for getting an **Access token** during the [authorisation process](page:apps-install#authorisation-process).|
| **Access&nbsp;token** | The token granted from your test shop to the newly created app. You can use this token for accessing the API. [Read here for further details.](page:apps-install) |

## Get your credentials

1. In the sidebar of your test shopâ€™s administration area, click **Apps**.

3. In the **Private apps** view, click **Add**.

4. Fill out the input field **App name** and specify the **Application Callback URL**.
Make sure the URL is https and publicly accessible.
Choose the required **App Scopes**. Read [here](https://developer.epages.com/apps/app-scopes.html) for further information on the scopes.
Note: HTTP Application Callback URLs can be used for private apps, but you need to provide an HTTPS URL if you want to submit the app.
Once this is done, click **Generate access data**.

5. You will be assigned your **App Scopes**, a **Client ID**, a **Client Secret** as well as an **Access token**.
The **Access token** is granted by your test shop, so that you can start accessing the ePages API immediately.

{% callout danger Warning %}
Store your **Client Secret** and **Access token** securely!
{% endcallout %}

## Happy coding!

Once this is done, you can start coding away.
But when developing your app, please consider our [API call limit](page:apps-api-call-limit).

## Test the authorisation process

Once you have implemented the authorisation flow in your app, you can trigger it by clicking the button **Test authorisation**.
Make sure that the **Applicaton Callback URL** for your app is correct.
Your app will be checked for proper implementation of the [OAuth 2.0 flow](page:apps-install#authorisation-process).

{% callout info Note %}
Triggering the test authorisation flow removes the existing **Access token** first.
{% endcallout %}

### Successful authorisation

If your authorisation has been successful, you will be assigned a new **Access token**.

### Unsuccessful authorisation

If the authorisation process failed, you will end up without having an **Access token**.
To create a new token without having passed a successful authorisation flow, simply create a new developer app.
