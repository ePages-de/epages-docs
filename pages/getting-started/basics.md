# The Developer Program
You are a developer and have a brilliant idea for an app that would perfectly fit for our online shop merchants? We'd love you to join our Developer Program! Using the ePages API, you can easily create a great app. Benefit from offering your app to merchants and earn money!

# The ePages API
The ePages API provides developers the interface to create awesome apps or single shop connections. It is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within ePages stores. With a standard interface to store data, it is very simple to create third party applications that can communicate with our merchant's stores.

Our highest claim is to ensure you're having a good time developing your app. That's why we're trying to make the API understandable for both coders and humans.

Let's make things less complicated: It's very easy to build and test applications, since the API is based on RESTful principles. The API uses the following standard HTTP verbs to make use of the required store data:

  * `GET ` (request)
  * `POST` (create)
  * `PUT` (modify)
  * `DELETE` (delete)

And what next? The API supports the JSON standard, which basically is the universal connector for data on the internet, and makes coders lives way easier, when using our RESTful API.
Requests to the API can only be made using HTTPS to grant access to authorised users only.

# The API documentation
Starting with the ePages API is simple. You've made it already through the short intro. Would you like to check out the [Use cases](doc:use-cases) now?

Or you can go directly for the GETTING STARTED section that provides all the necessary information on [registering](doc:registration) with our platform. Find out more about the [OAuth authentication process](doc:oauth) and the [API call limit](doc:api-call-limit).

The APPS section will get you on the road to develop your app. [Create an app](doc:create-an-app) and [submit an app](doc:submit-an-app) in no time!

The reference material for an API is an intrinsic part of any API - without it, the API is unusable. That's why every important aspect is explicitly stated in our API REFERENCE section [here](doc:resources).
