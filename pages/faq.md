# How do I get support?

Need support to set up your test shop? Have a look at our [Online Help](https://www.online-help-center.com/). You will find helpful and detailed articles about handling ePages shops.
Need support with the app development? Contact us! We will do our best to help you getting forward.

# How do I get my API key?

To get access to our REST API, you need to [sign in](page:apps-develop-app#registration) to our developer program. As soon as you're done with that, you will receive two emails: one will contain the credentials for your ePages shop, the other will contain your client token and client secret to access the REST API.

# What kind of apps can I submit?

Technically, the first version of the ePages developer program supports apps, that we call "connectors". These are external apps and also run externally, i.e. these apps do not integrate within the ePages software but connect to the ePages system via the REST API. From the eCommerce perspective, almost every kind of app that fulfils the technical requirements and that is an enrichment for our merchants can be submitted. We will then carefully review the app.
Nevertheless, the preferred app types for this first phase of the developer program are shipping, accounting, point of sale (POS) apps as well as marketplace and enterprise resource planning (ERP) apps.

# How does the approval process work?

When you're done with coding and been through with testing your app successfully, you can login to our test shop and [submit your app](page:apps-develop-app#submit-an-app). Fill out the form and that's it! We will carefully test your app and also review the information you provide us for the app store. Give us some time for the review process. It can take up to XXX days. When we're done, we will contact you whether your app has been approved or not. If your app has been approved, we will provide it in the ePages app store during the next XXX days/hours. If your app has been rejected, we will give you detailed feedback why. As soon as the required changes are done, you can submit your app again.

# What is the API call limit?

Depending on the ePages shop type, either 100 calls per day or 400 calls per day are accepted. Find more detailed information in the [API call limit](page:apps-using-the-api#api-call-limit) section.

# Is the API call limit per store or per app?

The API call limit is per store.

# How do I test my app before submitting it?

You can test your app within the ePages test shop. Make sure that the authorisation process works fine and that the app interacts properly with the ePages test shop.

# Do apps have to take into account special considerations for certain browsers?

???

# How can I provide an upgrade/a new version of an already published app?

???

# How long does it take to get the app listed in the app store once the app is submitted?

For sure, we're as excited as you are to include your app in our app store. It can take up to XXX days.
