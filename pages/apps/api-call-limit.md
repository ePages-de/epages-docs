Requests to the API are limited to 6000 calls per hour. The limit applies to all available resources.
Once the limit is exceeded, the request will be rejected. HTTP status `429 - Too many requests` will be returned and a message telling you that you've been limited, see also [Response codes](page:apps-response-codes).

The rate limit usage is returned in the response headers from each request, e.g.

{% highlight text %}
X-RateLimit-Limit: 6000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 5999
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 2015-02-20T13:14:34.611Z
{% endhighlight %}

X-RateLimit-Limit: number of calls you are allowed per hour

X-RateLimit-Remaining: number of calls you can make before hitting the limit

X-RateLimit-Reset: next time the quota will be reset.
