# Create an app

## What kind of apps do we support?
In a first approach, we support apps that connect via the REST API to the shop to exchange data and let the merchant work with these data within an external service.

## Set-up

1. Within your test shop backoffice, click the tab **Apps**.
2. In the drop down menu, choose the field **Developer Apps**.
3. In the **Developer Apps** view, click the button **Add**.
3. Fill out the entry field **App name**. This field is mandatory.
4. Click the button **Save**. You will be assigned a unique **Consumer key**, **Consumer secret** and **Access token**. Remember these credentials as you will have to integrate them into the configuration files or the actual code of your application.

{% callout danger Important! %}
For your application's own security: DO NOT share your **Consumer secret** with anyone!
{% endcallout %}

The credentials you'll receive might look like this:

{% image example-consumer-key-secret.png 50% %}
Example credentials
{% endimage %}

Once this is done, you can start coding off. You are free to use any kind of code language.
But when developing your app, please consider our [API call limit](page:apps-using-the-api#api-call-limit).
