# RESTful principle

Our highest claim is to ensure you're having a good time developing your app. That's why we're trying to make the API understandable for both developers and humans.

Let's make things less complicated: It's very easy to build and test applications, since the API is based on RESTful principles. The API uses the following standard HTTP verbs to make use of the required store data:

  * `GET` requests resources
  * `POST` creates resources
  * `PUT` modifies resources
  * `DELETE` deletes resources

# Schema

  * Requests to the API can only be made using HTTPS to enable secure, confident and unaltered data transmission and to grant access to authorised users only.
  * All URLs start with /rs/.
  * Every shop has its own REST end-point.
  * All data is sent and received using JSON.
  * All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.Z`)
