# Introduction

The ePages API provides developers the interface to create awesome apps or single shop connections. It is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within ePages stores. With a standard interface to store data, it is very simple to create third party applications that can communicate with our merchant's stores.

# Registration

Before you can start coding off you'll need to sign up for the ePages Developer Program and create a test shop. To use the ePages API you will need an application registration.

1. Sign up as a developer.
