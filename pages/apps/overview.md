# Introduction

The ePages API provides developers the interface to create awesome apps or single shop connections. It is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within ePages stores. With a standard interface to store data, it is very simple to create third party applications that can communicate with our merchant's stores.

# Your benefits

Not every application has the same business model – therefore we offer a flexible revenue share plan that meets individual requirements with the possibility to gain up to 70% of the revenue that the application generates via the App Store.

After your application has been submitted to us, our partner management will get in contact with you to determine the final application partnership agreement.

More details? If you have any questions related to the partner agreement, please contact our partner manager dummy-email@epages.com. To give you a fast and accurate answer, we kindly ask you to be as precise as possible, indicating your business model and defining the use case of your application.
