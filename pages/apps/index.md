# Introduction

The ePages API is based on RESTful principles, allowing you to code in whatever language you prefer. It supports JSON media types and uses UTF-8 character encoding.

Making use of this API, you can create awesome apps or single shop connections. It is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within ePages shops. With a standard interface to store data, it is very simple to create applications that can communicate with our merchant's stores.

In a first approach, we support 3rd party applications that connect via the REST API to ePages shops to exchange data. Within the application, the merchant can work with these data.

# Registration

Before you can start coding off you'll need to sign up for the ePages Developer Program and create a test shop. To use the ePages API you will need an application registration.

1. Sign up for the Developer Program.
    * Enter your name and email address in the required fields.
    * Agree to the terms and conditions.
    * Check your mailbox for the login details from your registration and create a test shop.
2. Log in to your test shop.
3. Get your [`clientID` and `clientSecret`](page:apps-develop-app#get-your-credentials).
