# Introduction

The ePages API is based on RESTful principles, allowing you to code in whatever language you prefer. It supports JSON media types and uses UTF-8 character encoding.

Making use of this API, you can create awesome apps or single shop connections. It is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within ePages shops. With a standard interface to store data, it is very simple to create applications that can communicate with our merchant's stores.

In a first approach, we support 3rd party applications that connect via the REST API to ePages shops, allowing them to exchange data and allowing the merchant to work with these data.

# Registration

Before you can start coding away, you'll need to sign up for the ePages Developer Program and create a test shop. To use the ePages API you will need an application registration.

1. [Sign up](http://www.epages.com/en/partner/developer-program/) for the Developer Program.
    * Enter your name and email address in the required fields.
    * Agree to the terms and conditions.
    * Check your mailbox for the login details from your registration and create a test shop.
2. Log in to your test shop.
3. Get your [**Client ID** and **Client Secret**](page:apps-create#get-your-credentials).

{% callout info Note: %}
The account for your test shop will be active for 365 days. After this period has been expired, the shop account can be prolonged for free.

If you're eager for more information on how to set up your test shop, check out our [Online Help](https://www.online-help-center.com/) for merchants.
