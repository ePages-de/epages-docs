# Who we are

Hey!

We are a great community of developers, scrum masters, UX experts, and Technical Communicators.
We love e-commerce and our daily business is hacking away on our online shop software.
We're regularly publishing posts here about our tech stack and ideas that drive us.
Here’s where we also post about work culture, meetups, events and conferences, and much more.

Enjoy!
