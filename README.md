## Usage

~~~ bash
# install dependencies
$ bundle

# run a local server with auto rebuilding
$ rake

# check for dead links and other bad stuff
$ rake test

# build the page
$ rake build

# update the RAML files from epagesj
$ rake ramlup
~~~

## Bootstrap your machine

Generally speaking you need only to make sure you have installed [Ruby][ruby] and [Bundler][bundler]. For platform specific instructions see the following subsections:

### Mac OS X

You can use this [shell script][bootstrap-macosx] to turn your OS X laptop into an awesome web development machine.

### Linux

You can use this [shell script][bootstrap-linux] to turn your laptop into an awesome web development machine.

### Windows

TODO

## Run in Docker

If you don't like to bootstrap your machine you can also run a [Docker][docker] container for development by invoking a single command only. The container will be pulled from our registry. You need to have [Docker Engine][docker-engine] installed first. The standard command of the container is the default `rake` task, which let's jekyll serve our site.

~~~ bash
# On Linux
$ echo "Open in browser: http://127.0.0.1:4000/"

# On Mac OS X (with one active docker machine)
$ echo "Open in browser: http://$(docker-machine ip `docker-machine active`):4000/"

# [Pull and] run container with mounting your local repo
$ docker run --rm --volume=$(pwd):/usr/src/epages-docs -p 4000:4000 -it docker.epages.com/epages/docs-ruby
~~~

#### Additional commands

The optional Docker image `<TAG>` can be set to `latest` (default if not defined), `develop`, `master` or `stable`, which represents the upstream branches in their current state. You may also set another tag like `local` if you build the image locally first.

~~~ bash
# Pull image from registry 
$ docker pull docker.epages.com/epages/docs-ruby:<TAG>

# [Pull and] run container with contained repo state
$ docker run --rm -p 4000:4000 -it docker.epages.com/epages/docs-ruby:<TAG>

# Build image locally
$ docker build -t docker.epages.com/epages/docs-ruby:<TAG> -f Dockerfile.ruby .

# Just build the _site dir in the mounted local repo on your host
$ docker run --rm --volume=$(pwd):/usr/src/epages-docs -p 4000:4000 -it docker.epages.com/epages/docs-ruby:<TAG> build

# Login to container pseudo-terminal, which works like a normal debian vm. 
# Inside the container `cd $EPAGES_DOCS` always gets you back to the epages-docs workdir.
$ docker run --rm --volume=$(pwd):/usr/src/epages-docs -p 4000:4000 -it docker.epages.com/epages/docs-ruby:<TAG> bash
~~~

#### Tips

* By appending arguments after the image name at the listed `docker run` commands you may execute other rake tasks individually (e.g. `rake test`, `rake index`, `rake build`, `rake serve` or in short: `test`, `index`, `build`, `serve`) as well as connect (e.g. `bash`) into the pseudo-terminal inside the container and do whatever you want.
* When running the container with a mounted host dir the `_site` dir will be created on the host with docker access rights (eq. user id from inside the container). You may sanitize your host dir with `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER _site` afterwards or just remove it as root `sudo rm _site`.
* `docker pull/run` of containers from our registry works without login inside our DMZ. From outside you first need to run `docker login` accordingly.
* Caution: For keeping things simple we run all commands inside the ruby container as root. In a production environment you would have to serve the jekyll site with user only privileges of course.
