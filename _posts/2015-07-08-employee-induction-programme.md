Most likely, everyone already has made their experience with being oriented to a new organisation.
Some might tell stories about the best first workday they ever had, others might have just repressed the thoughts about a scaring introductory day.
The first week of July, a bunch of new developers started at ePages.
What did we do to give them a good start and make their first days a success?

# 1. Welcome employee before employment even begins

All new employees that agreed a contract with us receive a welcome letter that includes:

* information about the starting date and time of the first workday
* an induction programme giving some indication of what will happen on their first days at ePages
* a personnel record that's to be completed by the day the employee starts with us

# 2. Involve teams and organise buddies

After all, a new developer will be part of a development **team**.
We spread out the induction plan to the team to have them informed about the new colleague being in which training, why and when.
This will allow the team to organise and plan their tasks accordingly and coordinate the induction sessions and pair programming with the new team member upfront.
Of course, this also includes setting up the workspace and ordering IT equipment.
We furthermore involve colleagues from other departments to volunteer as mentors for the new employees.
Here at ePages we call them "buddies".

# 3. First work day: Meet with new employees right away

When having arrived at the office, HR welcomes the new employees, a round of introductions follows and the further course of the day will be explained.

Our CTO gives a brief introduction including:

* Development teams and their tasks
* Goals and targets
* Software architecture
* Benefits for our merchants

# 4. Buddy time!

Get the newbies into contact with their buddies and off they go exploring the office.
This is all about settling-in and clarifying feel-good issues as:

* Coffee machine
* Rest rooms
* Kitchen use
* Storage areas
* Office systems
* Social rooms

Buddies show the layout of the offices and the new workplace, introduce the new employees to staff of other departments and may answer any questions that the employee is not comfortable posing to the team or supervisor.
They'll be shown their workplaces as well as important contact points.

# 5. Introduction session with HR

Our HR team then hands out the office keys and local transport tickets and familiarises our new employees.
This includes:

* Orga chart
* Company values
* Benefits
* Documents to be submitted
* Travel guidelines
* Target agreement discussions
* Company events and holidays
* Applications for leave and sick leave

# 6. Team lunch

Phew! It's definitely time for a break and getting to know the team members during lunch.

# 7. At the desk with the team

Now it's team time: Setting up the workplace, configuring the laptop, collecting office materials and receiving more "getting started" information from the team.

# And what's next?

It's most probably information overkill.
The first day is over and the new colleagues have lot's of new information in their luggage.
The agenda for the following days contains some more interesting topics and valuable tipps for a good start at ePages.

Certainly, it takes plenty of time and coaching to get new employees up to speed.
But it will lay the groundwork to get them familiar with the team and ensures, they feel like valued members of the company.
