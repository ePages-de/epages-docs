For the fifth time about 1.500 developers gathered for the yearly `code.talks` conference in Hamburg:
on September 29 and 30 also a dozen ePagees went to the Cinemaxx Hamburg Dammtor to enjoy two days fully packed with [lots of talks](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm) from 13 different tracks.
Each track focussed on a specific theme like E-Commerce, IT Management, Startups, New Technology, Big Data, Mobile, DevOps, Scaling, Infrastructure, UX/Frontend, PHP, JavaScript and Java - the latter also being sponsored by ePages.
Each hour talks from these tracks where held in parallel at eight movie theater rooms.
Watching these talks on huge cinema screens while sitting in cozy chairs and eating popcorn with nachos is a very special experience!

Due to the huge amount of different talks there was almost always at least one interesting session for everyone - more often than not it was a tough choice between two or more competing topics being presented at the same time.
Between the talks there was time for meeting and networking with other visitors to exchange impressions and ideas.
All the time there was more than enough excellent food and drinks provided; not only water, coffee and tea, but of course also [l33t mate](http://www.1337mate.com/) ;-)

Those not already too exhausted by the intense first day had the chance to spend their energy during a exclusive party in the evening/night, also with vouchers for free drinks.
At next day's breakfast you could clearly tell who had a tough night, but judging from the full conference rooms only a few visitors slept in.

## The talks

I (Jens) started the conference attending talks highly related to my current assignment at ePages:
[Microservices](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/radical-agility-with-autonomous-teams-and-microservices-in-the-cloud), [Docker containers](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/patterns-in-a-containerized-world), [Consul](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/die-cloud-im-griff-mit-consul), [Mesos & Marathon](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/scalable-micro-services-with-apache-mesos-and-marathon) are technologies my team evaluates to create a new architecture for our product.
The amount of relevant input from these talks was so intense that I had to switch to other topics in the afternoon.
Choosing the very entertaining talk about creating PDFs using JavaScript for [printing out websites](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/internet-ausdrucken-mit-javascript) was a welcome alternative and recharged my batteries to focus on [e-commerce topics](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/demystify-the-commercetools-platform-how-to-build-a-global-e-commerce-api-platform) in the afternoon.

On Wednesday I started the conference with [Microservices](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/microservices-und-die-jagd-nach-mehr-konversion) and [e-commerce](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/spryker-e-commerce-framework-als-alternative-zu-traditioneller-shop-software) talks.

Again it proved to be a good choice to regain some energy by joining a more entertaining talk covering [elephants and squirrels](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/liebling-ich-habe-das-framework-geschrumpft) before diving back into [e-commerce](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/der-kunde-im-fokus-personalisierte-aussteuerung-von-inhalten-als-erfolgsfaktor-im-e-commerce) and [Docker](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/docker-why-we-shouldn-t-use-it) again.
The biggest pleasant surprise for me that day was the talk about [monkey testing with genetic algorithms](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/wenn-affen-testen-das-ende-der-bananensoftware), though.

I really enjoyed the diversity of talks, which allowed me to switch focus based on my cognitive capacity.
Of course different talks had different levels of complexity and quality, but my general impression was that most speakers knew their topic pretty well and were also able to deliver their talk in an interesting fashion.
And meeting old and new contacts from _our_ development community in a friendly and relaxing environment is always something to look for.
