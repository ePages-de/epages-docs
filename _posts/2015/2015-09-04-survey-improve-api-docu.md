Opinions, views and also tastes differ on how an API documentation should be structured, which information should be provided and in which level of detail is appropriate.
Of course, the aim is to provide all important and required information for developers working with our API to keep things simple and easy to handle.
In order to achieve this, we'd like to involve the most important target group here: developers!

We prepared a short survey to find out more about the expectations and requirements you have in order to easily work with an API documentation.
We kindly ask you to participate and share your opinion with us.
The survey will take approx. 5 to 10 minutes.
