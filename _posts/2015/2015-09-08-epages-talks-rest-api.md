Have you signed up for the [`code.talks`](https://www.codetalks.de/) 2015 in Hamburg?
This conference thrives on a variety of interesting topics in the field of web development, exciting talks and of course lots of fun.
And we're participating!

Speaker: Oliver Trosien

Topic: Documented and Tested Microservices for Fun and Profit

Date & Time: 30th of September 2015, 10:00 - 10:45 a.m.

Location: Room 7

Abstract: Software documentation is not one of a developer's best-loved topics.
In the field of Microservices, it is therefore all the more important to provide a meaningful and well documented REST API that other teams and external developers can build upon.
So, let's build some nice REST API docs!

The `code.talks` will be also a great chance to meet with ePages developers and designers to network, exchange experience as well as discuss best practices.

Hope to see you all!
