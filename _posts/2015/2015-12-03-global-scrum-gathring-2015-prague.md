From 16th to 18th of November I had the pleasure of visiting the Global Scrum Gathering in Prague. It's been three days filled with so many interesting workshops, presentations and getting to know people. Most often there were six slots in parallel and it was a tough call on deciding for one of them. So here is a short summary of the workshops I attended and found most interesting.

#Keynote by Niels Pflaeging - "Organize for Complexity"

{% image NielsPlaegingOrganizationForComplexity.jpg 50% left %}Niels Pflageging Keynote Organize for Complexity{% endimage %}

The first Keynote was presented by Niels Pflaeging and followed the ideas of his book "Organize for Complexity". The basic idea is that top down management structures were working in the industrial age with slow moving dull markets, but that they dye with the fast moving markets today. He described organisations as peaches rather than pyramids, with a centre and a periphery. The customer always contacts the periphery and the periphery the centre. The problem with pyramids is that if the centre would steer, they would be too slow and also lack of the information the periphery has. So he suggests to build teams or squads in the periphery and let them steer. It's the idea of empowered self-organised teams and he also had a whole slide with example companies (big ones!) that are already working this way, to prove it works.

One really interesting point was when he started to talk about the theory of X- and Y-people.

Everyone in the room was supposed to fill out a sticky note if he/she thinks weather they are a X or a Y person and a second sticky note with a guess of percentage of people who think they are a X person. Then we exchanged notes so they got anonymous those holding an X were supposed to raise their hands. It appeared that out of the around 500 guests only a handful was holding an X and the presenter said out of statistics you can round that to zero. So the conclusion is that there are no X-people, but in organisations there are a lot of systems for X-people. Following that Nieals Pflaeging presented an statistic showing that only 5% of the problems at work occur due to people while 95% of the problems come from the organisational systems. Systems that got designed for non-existing X-people are destructive and we should get rid of them. He had a whole slide with examples, but I personally most liked his statement: **"Bonus systems are a crime against humanity."**

#Ralph Miarka - From Non-Violent Communication to Potential-Focused Communication

One of the workshops I visited enhanced the idea of Non-Violent Communication (if you haven't heard of it yet, you can find an explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) ) with solution focused thinking. That means while the non-violent communication is centred on problems, you should rather focus on the future. Talking about problems creates problems, but talking about the future opens up new possibilities. Ralph Miarka enhanced the non-violent communication model to:

Potential Focused Communication
1. Preferred observation
2. Preferred feelings
3. Needs
4. Solution focused questions

That means in detail: In the first step you should talk about your preferred observation (not what you observed in the past). Then you should tell the other person how you would like to feel (not what you felt when the problem occurred) followed by expressing your needs and solution focused questions. With this strategy people don't get negatively influenced or personally hurt, as it can happen with the non-violent communication. It also opens up for constructive conversations much easier.

#Gary Bamberger - Introduction to Coaching Skills for SMs and Leaders

In this workshop Gary Bamberger gave a nice introduction to what coaching actually is and how you do it. He explained that Coaches help to expand the thinking of the Clients so he/she finds own solution ideas for his/her problems. Coaches don't dictate the solutions. He introduced seven Coaching Skills you can use in a session:

1. Curiosity
2. Powerful questions - not judging
3. Silence
4. Listening
5. Reflecting
6. Interruption
7. Acknowledgment

A coaching session itself should follow three steps:

1. Clarify what is the topic?
2. Coaching -> use the skills
3. Commitment -> Set a fixed goal including a timeframe to achieve it.

After the theory part we went to practicing it in groups of three. One person presenting a problem, the second one coaching him and the third person was observing and giving feedback after the coaching session. The funniest problem in our group was definitely "My daughter wants a kitten for Christmas!" It was really interesting to try it and afterwards we all agreed that the hardest part is to not give solutions when you are confronted with a problem but try and get the person to find the solution himself.

#Taghi Paksima - Slowing down to speed up: agile and technical debt

At the second day Taghi Paksima was talking about technical debt, its consequences and how to tackle it. He used a really nice definition for the term:

>"Technical debt is all the mess you are leaving behind when you think you are done."

As consequences of TD he listed the creation of a financial burden, the killing of productivity and also that it makes maintenance difficult. Most interesting was the point that too much technical debt can even lead to reverse the culture in the team or company from "we are good" to "life sucks" (Following the Tribal culture: 1 = Life sucks, 2 = I'm good, 3 = We are good, 4 = Life is good). He also made clear that TD is inevitable, but there is a big difference between conscious decisions to do something quick and dirty right now but having a payback plan later, or doing unconscious TD or even conscious TD without a payback plan.

Following that his advice to tackle TD was to make it visible. Use a special kind of Ticket to make it visible either on the backlog or a separate board. And then either plan it from the backlog or take a certain percentage of the sprint (e.g. block one day per Sprint) to only work on TD.

#Pavel Dabrytski - Scrum Economics 101: Contracts, Budgets, Capitalization

{% image ScrumEconimics01.jpg 50% left %}Time - Cost - Scope triangle in waterfall and agile development.{% endimage %}

Tuesday afternoon I visited a presentation packed with information! Pavel Dabrytski was teaching the audience all the basics about contract, budgets and capitalization in Scrum. It was really interesting to hear it from someone that has worked with this in praxis. There were many information I couldn't fully grab because I've never worked in Sales, so my advice would be to have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cteAb9Ap7_4).
It's roughly the same presentation Pavel was holding on the Agile Africa conference this year.

What I could take out for me are the different contract models you can use in Scrum. They are all based on the idea to fix time and cost, but not scope.

From that you can work with the following contract models:

* Upper limit contract: Fixed cost, fixed time, see what's done until then
* Contract for only 3-4 Sprints: see how the team is processing -> then make long term contract
* Contract per Sprint
* Fixed Profit -> share risk
    Both are interested to finish early
    E.g. 20k per Sprint for a fixed time, if not finished by then go down to 15k per Sprint (if team costs 15k) = finish late scenario
* Target price -> Money for nothing, change for free
    Finish early scenario
    Sprints that were paid but not needed anymore -> pay back 25% per Sprint
* You can combine the last two contract models

You can find all the slides of this presentation on [Slideshare](http://de.slideshare.net/PavelDabrytski/agile-economics-budgets-contacts-capitalization).

#Lightning Talks

The last presentations at day two were the lightning talks. That means the presenters only had 5 minutes to talk about their topic in front of the whole big audience. I found this format quite refreshing and took some notes from different speakers that caught my attention. First a collection of random but important sentences:

* Don't separate designers (UX/PM) from Developers.
* Don't rotate people, create stable teams!
* Scrum is an iterative Prisoners Dilemma game.
* Managers in Scrum
* Open doors -> everyone needs to have the opportunity to speak openly ideas
    Be there -> physically, do nothing, things will come up
* Give recognition (everybody can do that, doesn't need to be a manager)

Then there was a lightning talk about Retrospectives that was summed up with the top 10 tips:

1. Good venues -> outside of the office!
2. Get people moving -> more energy
3. Food & Drinks -> fresh things, no chocolate
4. State the purpose -> "We are going to talk about..." ->get people's attention in 10 minutes
5. Experiment with metaphor
6. Let people play
7. Encourage healthy conflicts ->Let people know its ok to disagree
8. Keep things varied -> change something, not everything at a time
9. Reflect on facts
10. Take some actions

The last speaker was really inspiring. He was talking about building products, especially software, and why users often have trouble to use it. He said the cause of this problem is that: "We are building for others what we want for ourselves." But we are not the customer. He suggested we should always think about our mum! With all the new technology she might feel stupid and that's not what we want. He said that Product Owners would often be better if they weren't computer scientists but socialists, psychologists or mums.

#Open Space

{% image OpenSpace.jpg %50% left %}Open Space Topics Overview{% endimage %}

The last day of the Global Scrum Gathering was created as an Open Space. I was really impressed that this form of meetup worked even with 500 participants and 15 parallel groups for each of the three timeslots. It was more than hard to decide where to go because there were so many interesting topics.

{% image SMdiary.jpg 50% left %}Flipchart from the Scrum Master Diary Group{% endimage %}

In the end the two most interesting slots for me were "Scrum Masters Diary" and "Transition Team". The Scrum Masters Diary Group wanted to tackle the problem that also most people understand what the general role of a Scrum Master is, nobody actually has a clue what they are doing the whole day. And for us Scrum Masters it's hard to explain since no day is like the other. So we decided to start an initiative called the "Scrum Master Diary" where we wanted to collect descriptions of ordinary days at work of Scrum Masters. Nothing made up, not putting all the interesting things that ever happened into one day, just describing one whole day as it went. We are still collecting until 30th of November and want to publish a website after that.

{% image TransitionTeam.jpg 50% left %}Flipchart from the Transition Team Group{% endimage %}

In the Transition Team discussion we had people from several organisations talking about who is in their transition teams and what are these teams doing in detail. It was really interesting to find out similarities and differences and find out, what one could use for the own organisation.

#Mingling Time

{% image food.jpg 50% left %}{% endimage %}

Apart from all the workshops there were also several occasions, planned or unplanned, where we had the opportunity to get to know new people. We were enjoying the new company with amazing Czech food, endless amount of beer and great sightseeing.
