In end of august 2015 the [6. BarCamp in Kiel][barcampkiel] took place. More than 80 developer, designer, blogger and shop owner take part on it. They take a lecture and discuss several topics. The focus point in this year was technology, media and education. ePages was there too and gives a short review about the visited topics.

# What is a BarCamp?

The BarCamp is an international conference with only user-generated lectures and speechs. Every interested persom can join them for free and take part in interesting discussions. Main topics are technology and media, but most BarCamps focus on special subjects like medicine or social science.
If you want to take part search [online][wherearethecamps] when some Camp start around you and feel free to join.

# LECTURE: Clean code and testing

One of the most interesting topic for developer is the problem to write complex code without loosing the focus on a clean and structured architecture. In additional to this the code should be tested and work after change some lines of code. There are several tools to guarantee this.

But how tidy should be source code without loosing focus in a fast-weight development? And which tools can help to optimize code and test it regularly?

A good base can be given by the confinuous integration tool [Jenkins][jenkins]. It's open source and helps to develop any component to a program. Another important software can with program in Java. The tool [FindBugs][findbugs] help to find errors in code before the software crashes. With [JUnit][junit] you can test your software. [Checkstyle][checkstyle] is a nice feature to define developing standards like number of chars per line. All these software can be find as plugin for the IDE [Eclipse][eclipse].

Good books to read about a quaility in code standard is ["Clean Code" by Robert Martin][cleancode] or ["Writing Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers][writinglegacy]. The lastquestion about Clean Code is, how good a code quality should be in relation of the quantity.

# LECTURE: The mBot

A often spoken question is how early and deep the education of information technology should start in school. The school lesson computer science gives the wrong overview for planning, developing and understanding software principels and their ideas. For educate younger (and maybe also older) people to making software development the chinese company [Makeblock][makeblock] created a robot called ["mBot"][mbot]. This project can help children learning simple software algorithmen. They use the graphic user interface ["Scratch"][scratch] to let the robot move, see and react with the surrounding.

Their are serveral other education concepts for learning informatics in the school. The company [Lego][lego] hosts the [First Lego League competition][legocompetition] every year, the network [Roberta][roberta] communicates for schools for implementing it.

# LECTURE: Gamification in projects

In the BarCamp there were also topics for team and project organising. Some was how to motivate teams for a long time in disencouraging projects.

A concept for the long-time motivation is the gamifaction. Currently Gamifaction is present in customer software. Software allure with ranking lists and virtual goods. Is it possible to adapt these concept to team structure? Some interesting concept like [ClassCraft][classcraft] show that this work. The idea is to motivate younger people in roleplay game. The student gets bonus like one solved question in the next math test for doing helping other students and doing social stuff.

If gamification will work two ideas should be considered: The person how will be take part on this gamification should not see the real aim: doing a task. And the part-taking-person should not know the whole "rules". He should not see what he needs to do to win the game. Some companies try concepts like presenting a list of unpopular tasks. If a employee will finish an defined number of these tasks he will get a vacation day. Also an interesting idea is to bet to a team related number after a special time period. Some teams in companys make a bet to the number of solved tasks after a month.
