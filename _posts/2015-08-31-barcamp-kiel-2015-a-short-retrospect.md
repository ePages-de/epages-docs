Last weekend, more than 80 developers, designers, bloggers and shop owners participated in the [6. BarCamp in Kiel][barcampkiel], Germany. They look lectures and discussed several topics. This year, the focus was laid on technology, media and education. I've represented ePages there. Here's my short review on the topics.

# What is a BarCamp?

Change to: ... and speeches. Every person interested can join for free and take part in interesting discussions. The main topics are technology and media but most of the BarCamps focus on special subjects like medicine or social science.
If you're interested in participating in a BarCamp, search [online][wherearethecamps] and feel free to join.

# LECTURE: Clean code and testing

One of the most interesting topics for developers is the challenge to write complex code without loosing the focus on a clean and structured architecture. Additionally, this code should be tested and work properly after changing some lines. Several tools help to ensure this.

But how tidy should be source code without loosing focus in a fast-weight development? And which tools can help to optimise code and test it regularly?

A good base can be given by the continuous integration tool [Jenkins][jenkins]. It's open source and helps to develop any component to a programme. Other important software comes with programming in Java. The tool [FindBugs][findbugs] helps to find errors in code before the software crashes. With [JUnit][junit] you can test your software. [Checkstyle][checkstyle] is a nice feature to define developing standards like number of chars per line. All this software is available as a plugin for the IDE [Eclipse][eclipse].

Good books on quaility in code standard are e.g. ["Clean Code" by Robert Martin][cleancode] or ["Writing Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers][writinglegacy]. The lastquestion about Clean Code is, how well should the code quality be in relation to the quantity.

# LECTURE: The mBot

A common question is how early and deep the education of information technology should start in school. School lessons in computer science give the wrong overview on planning, developing and understanding software principles and their ideas. To educate younger (and maybe also older) people to making software development, the Chinese company [Makeblock][makeblock] created a robot called ["mBot"][mbot]. This projects support children to learn simple software algorithms. They use the graphic user interface ["Scratch"][scratch] to let the robot move, see and react with the surrounding.

There are several other educational concepts for learning informatics at school. The company [Lego][lego] hosts the [First Lego League competition][legocompetition] every year, the network [Roberta] is closely connected with schools to implement this.

# LECTURE: Gamification in projects

One of the lectures was related to team and project organisation, e.g. how to motivate teams over a long time in disencouraging projects.

A concept for the long-time motivation is the Gamification. Currently, Gamification is present in customer software. Software allures with ranking lists and virtual goods. Is it possible to adapt this concept to the team structure? An interesting concept like [ClassCraft][classcraft] show that this work. The idea is to motivate younger people with role-playing games. The student gets bonus like one solved question in the next math test for doing helping other students and doing social stuff.

If Gamification should work, two ideas should be considered: the person taking part in the Gamification should not see the real aim, i.e. carrying out a task. And they should not be aware of all the "rules". They should not see what is needed to win the game. Some companies try concepts like presenting a list of unpopular tasks. If an employee finishes a defined number of theses tasks, they will receive a day of vacation. Also an interesting idea is to bet to a team related number after a special time period. Some teams in companies bet on the number of task solved after a month.
