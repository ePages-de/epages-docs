Come and meet us in real life @ code.talks, Hamburg! We are Java Track Sponsor for one of the largest developer conferences in Europe. Sign up for `code.talks` on September 29 and 30, 2015 to meet with ePages developers and designers. This will be a great chance to network, exchange experience and discuss best practices.

The conference thrives on a variety of interesting topics in the field of web development, exciting talks and of course lots of fun. ePages developers will participate actively in the conference and give interesting talks and insights into their field of work.
As soon as there's more detailed information on the topics, you will of course read it here.

Hope to see you all!
