Lots of refugees have landed in Germany. Along with it
there are lots of challenges. Though I am not able to work day and night
for the solution as some people in the crisis management group I wanted to
raise a flag to show that there is a significant amount of people who are willing to help.
This blog post is a report about my journey to the #refugeehackathon.

# Overview of the event
The [#refuggeehackathon](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23refugeehackathon)
started on Friday, 24. Oct. with a requirements workshop
where a couple of people visited the refugees and talked about project
ideas which would be helpful for them. The official start was at Saturday
morning. After some words of welcome a short video about the challenging
situation of refugees traveling through Europe was shown. Then there was a motivational
speech from a Somalian lady. She invited us not to label people as refugees
but to regard them as newcomers. Afterwards there was a presentation of the
project ideas from the workshop and already existing ones.

# The Volunteer Planner project
The project which I selected was the [Volunteer Planner](https://volunteer-planner.org/).
It is an online platform created by two handfuls of programmers, designers
and project managers which enables volunteers to sign up for tasks identified
by different aid organizations. Though the project is only three month old
and thus not yet features complete they already have 19.354 registered users
and 51.286 completed volunteer work hours.

# What we could achieve
At beginning we collected and discussed feature ideas for the Volunteer Planner.
Then we prioritized them (which was shown in
[the news](http://www.heute.de/refugee-hackathon-in-berlin-digitale-fluechtlingshilfe-in-48-stunden-von-it-leuten-40700228.html))
and afterwards we started to work in pairs on the things we were most interested in.
We implemented an overview page for individual the aid organisations,
a language switch and fixed a couple of interesting bugs.

My main focus was on the implementation of a feature which will
enable staff of aid organizations to maintain their volunteer shifts by
themselves instead of mailing them to the admin team.
We created a [wireframe model](https://gomockingbird.com/projects/fnzc6qu)
for the shift creation workflow and a shift template mechanism similar to online
banking transactions. Later on it should be extended with some kind of batch templates
for the support of power users. For any reason we did not manage to finish
the implementation in time so there is still some pending work after
the hackathon.

# Conclusion
Finally it was a very rich experience for me. I came to know interesting
people and we had a lot of fun together. Further I learned a number of lessons
about web development in general and Python/Django in particular.

Hopefully my journey will also result in a little bit of practical help
for the newcomers.

So many thanks at [@ePages](https://twitter.com/ePages) for sponsoring some work hours,
the train tickets and hotel costs!
