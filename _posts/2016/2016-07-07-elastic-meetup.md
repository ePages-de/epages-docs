On the 30th of June the third [jenadevs](http://www.meetup.com/jenadevs/events/230859746) meetup took place at the ePages office in Jena.
A video conference with our office in Hamburg was also established to give more people the option to attend remotely.

Approximately 30 participants were interested in the topic and showed up at 6 pm.
After a short general introduction the presentations started:

### Elastic Stack 5.0

[Pere Urbón-Bayes](http://www.purbon.com/) ([elastic](https://www.elastic.co)) walked through the new features of the Elastic 5 stack and explained for every component what's new and what changed.
Further information on this topic: [elastic v5](https://www.elastic.co/de/v5).

### Visualisation and analysis of Open Data

[Achim Friedland](https://twitter.com/ahzf) ([OK Lab Jena](http://codefor.de/jena/)) presented the [CODE for Germany](http://codefor.de/) project and how it uses open data to visualise and solve problems.
He showed some examples of visualised Open Data.

### Elastic Stack @ePages

[Christian Köhler](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs) ([ePages](http://www.epages.com/)) presented the current Elastic stack at ePages.
He explained the approach and the lessons learned to build the centralised logging framework.

### Regression Test Analysis with Elasticsearch in a Delivery Pipeline

[Benjamin Nothdurft](https://twitter.com/dataduke) and [Bastian Klein](https://twitter.com/Dastianoro) ([epages](http://www.epages.com/)) presented a short version of their implementation of the ElasticSearch, Logstash and Docker integration for aggregation and collection of integration test results from various systems in the delivery pipeline ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/dataduke/automated-test-evaluation-short-version)).

### Lightning Talk: How Elasticsearch was used in former projects

[Jens Fischer](https://twitter.com/jensfischerhh) ([ePages](http://www.epages.com/)) talked about [deploying the Elastic stack](https://slidr.io/jensfischerhh/deploying-the-elastic-stack) in one of his former projects and the adoption of the new technology.

In the end delivering all this content took about one hour longer than planned,
but even the UEFA EM 2016 match Poland vs. Portugal was gladly skipped by all participants.

After the presentations we had some nice discussions about the usage of Elasticsearch with some pizza and beer.
