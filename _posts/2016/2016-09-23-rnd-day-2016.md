Last week, we hosted another R&D Day at ePages, that provided great insights into the future of our software.
This year's focus was clearly on new technologies.
Developers from all company locations gathered together in Hamburg to present their latest development results as well as important tasks that are in the pipeline for the upcoming months.

We kicked off with a breakfast to prepare for the day ahead and strengthen us for our presentations on stage.
It was also a nice occasion for first chats and networking talks with colleagues from other teams and locations.

## On stage

During the course of the day we had 7 talks in total on various topics such as "Kubernetes quick dive-in", "Faster to the cloud using modern Java frameworks", "Multistore refurbished" or "Consistent language & localized UI".
Here's just a quick overview of the keynote presentations.

### Architecture

Our Team Black started off with a general overview of the new ePages architecture.
They presented the current status of the features they implemented during the last months as well as the roadmap for what they're approaching next.
Their work emphasizes on a microservice architecture, where they build and enhance a complete new API and software backend as well as a new UI for our merchants.
With the help of tools and technologies such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana), [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/) and various [Spring](https://spring.io/) projects they currently implement all required functionalities for a complete user journey.

### Storefront, administration, editor

Next on stage was our Team Unity with a presentation of the current status of our new editor and responsive storefront as well as the reworked shop administration.
They explained the magic behind this new technology stack which is based on Docker, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html).

## Workshops

The afternoon was packed with workshops held by various teams in parallel.
Participants could choose upfront between one of the following topics:

* Build & deploy microservices
* Theme building
* Release automation
* Easy log file access for developers

## Social event

Just in time we were done for a sundowner and a cool drink.
Together with the colleagues from all the other departments, we spent our evening in a nice beach club over the rooftops of Hamburg.
