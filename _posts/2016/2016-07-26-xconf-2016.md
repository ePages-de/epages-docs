Not so long time ago, in one of so few sunny days in Hamburg I have had an opportunity to visit
[XConf](https://info.thoughtworks.com/Xconf-hamburg-2016.html). Here in ePages, developers have a great support by the company if they are interested in self-education.

This yearly event took place on 12th of July in a cozy place [Betahaus](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/) in format of one day conference covering "broad range of technology topics".

Thanks to the great job made by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) I have enjoyed time participating it.

It was a surprise for me to meet another developer from my company deciding to visit this conference as well.

## Keynote

[James Lewis](https://twitter.com/boicy) presented the keynote talking about Lean Software Engineering, [LEGO](http://lego.com) and [Star Wars](http://www.starwars.com/).
Sometimes when people present processes they make theirs presentation too abstract and might loose the audience on the way.
What was interesting in this presentation, that he was able to illustrate in a form of a story, processes problems and discussed ways of solving them.
And everything with help of [LEGO](http://lego.com) building a Millennium Falcon.
With such presentation techniques he was able to explain several concepts including cycle-time and throughput, continuous process improvement to people who are not familiar with the topic.

## Presentations

Every participant could choose one of the two tracks running in parallel.

We have decided to visit Track 1 because there were lots of topics we want to get more insides on how other companies are dealing with.

**Content of Track 1:**

 - Containerizing a web shop - Building the microservice platform for otto.de
 - Implementing Infrastructure as Code
 - A High-Performance Solution to Microservice UI Composition
 - Serverless Architecture - Tales from a world without servers
 - Alert overload: How to adopt a MS architecture without being...

## Impression

In general, presentations were really nice: well structured content, experienced speakers and interesting topics.
One good takeaway of the conference was to see that many companies are using and applying the same techniques and tools that we are using internally.

Especially, it was really interesting to hear about experience of introducing microservices architecture on such giant environment as [otto.de](http://otto.de)

It is good to now that one of the leaders of German e-Commerce market following the same principles as we are following in our team.

Other interesting topic was the Infrastructure.
In ePages we have a quite sophisticated environment structure. To manage those, we are already applying many techniques and tools described by [Kief Morris](https://twitter.com/kief) in his presentation.
