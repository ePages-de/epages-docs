A few years ago, at the time when the development of the ePages REST API started,
ePages 6 was just a huge monolith written in Perl and already hard to handle.
Since the monolith should not be inflated even more and in order to be able to use state-of-the-art frameworks,
the REST API was started as a separate service implemented in JAVA.

This service communicates with the monolith via REST and SOAP in order to operate on the data we won't to expose to the public.
All the API related business logic like right management and rate limits are implemented in JAVA such that the API's we had to implement in Perl could
become quiete simple.

Of course all the resource and services classes are coverey by unit test on both sides, Perl and Java,
but since the functionality of the API is based on two different projects that live in two different repositories
which have two different teams responsible for the releases,
we wanted to have a simple way to check with one click if everything - from end to end - is working as expected.

This was the starting point of RAT - our Rest API Test framework.

## RAT

The idea of RAT was to create a framework that allows us to easily verify the state of the REST API on an abritrary ePages installation.

In order to do so, RAT sends requests to the API and validates the response.
To be able to compare the response with an expected one, we let the test base on shop of the DemoShopType
(The developer installation of ePages includes a DemoShopType which allows to create a demo shop with certain products of different types and a few orders).
We wanted the test cases to be able to run in a arbitrary order. The problem is that some of the API calls change a shop (DELETE product),
which lead to different results in the following calls. The solution is to create new shops for testing those calls.
The ePages6 REST API does not offer an endpoint to create new shops so far, so we used the ePages SOAP API to do that.

RAT is based on [REST-assured](http://rest-assured.io/) and [Serenity BDD](http://www.thucydides.info), two tools that take over a lot of work on the way to produce nice test results. In the next paragraphs I will introduce these tools briefly and show how we use them.

### REST-assured

The certain test cases are implemented using REST-assured. It is a framework that is specially designed for testing REST APIs and allows easily to send different kind of requests and validation of their responses.

A simple check if the product resource of our REST API is returning 22 products could look like that:

{% highlight java %}
given()
    .baseUri("http://some-host-with-an-epages-installation")
    .basePath("rs/shops/DemoShop")
    .accept("application/json")
.when()
    .get("products")
.then()
    .assertThat()
    .statusCode(200)
    .and()
    .body("results", equalTo(22));
{% endhighlight %}

So REST-assured allows us to do request and validation in one step (*assertThat()* and *and()* are syntactic sugar and could be left out).

In RAT we usually store the result for later use (e.g. extracting the links and follow them with further requests)
and do the validation in a separate step.

Since baseUri and request headers are for every request more or less the same, we put the request specification in a separate class.
{% highlight java %}
JsonPath products = requestSpecification
                    .get("products")
                    .then()
                    .assertThat() //
                    .statusCode(200) //
                    .and() //
                    .extract() //
                    .body() //
                    .jsonPath();
{% endhighlight %}

...

#### JSONPath ####

REST-assured comes already with a library for JSONPath (which is basically [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) for JSON) namely [com.jayway.restassured:json-path](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.jayway.restassured/json-path),
that can be used to validate a JSON response and verify certain attributes.

Unfortunately this library does not implement all the JSONPath expressions from [Stefan GÃ¶ssner's JSONPath specification](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) - that's why we use [com.jayway.jsonpath:json-path](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.jayway.jsonpath/json-path) instead.
To use this library we cannot simply do *... .extract().body().jsonPath();* anymore. Instead we have to get the response as a string first and then parse it as JsonPath object in a second step:

{% highlight java %}
import com.jayway.jsonpath.DocumentContext;
import com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath;

// ...

String body = requestSpecification.get("products")
            .then().assertThat().statusCode(200)
            .extract().body().asString();

DocumentContext products = JsonPath.parse(body);
{% endhighlight %}

Using this library we can finally do some more powerful things like:

{% highlight java %}
int itemCount = products.read("items.length()");
// or
List<String> productNames = products.read("items[*].name");
{% endhighlight %}



### Serenity BDD

Similar to [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) in the Ruby world,
Serentiy allows you to describe and structure the test cases in way that acts like a complete specification with a checklist.

{% highlight java %}
@RunWith(SerenityRunner.class)
public class WhenUploadingProductImage {

    private static final String IMAGE_NAME = "scrum-values-800x800.jpg";

    @Steps(uniqueInstance=true)
    ProductImageSteps steps;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        steps.given_a_demo_shop();
        steps.given_a_developer_token();
    }

    @After
    public void teardown() {
        steps.invalidate_shop();
    }

    @Test
    public void uploaded_image_is_added_to_slideshow() {
        steps.given_the_first_product();
        steps.when_uploading_a_product_image(IMAGE_NAME);
        steps.then_the_product_slideshow_contains_image(IMAGE_NAME);
        steps.when_the_product_image_is_changed_with_slideshow_image(IMAGE_NAME);
        steps.then_the_product_image_is_changed_accordingly();
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

The certain test steps are in a separate classes. We have a class *ShopSteps* which contains tests that are shop specific and needed in all tests. Then we have e.g. *ProductSteps* inherting from ShopSteps for steps that are used in product-related tests.

This example shows the *ProductImageSteps* (which for their part inherit from *ProductSteps*) because the test is about product images. It only contains those steps that are relevant for product image-related tests:

{% highlight java %}
public class ProductImageSteps extends ProductSteps {

    @Step("When uploading image {0} for product")
    public void when_uploading_a_product_image(String imageName) {
        // ... upload image using REST-assured ...
    }

    @Step("Then the product slideshow contains image '{0}'")
    public void then_the_product_slideshow_contains_image(String imageName) {
        // ... get slideshow using REST-assured and check if the imageName appears in the result ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Serenity offers the *@Step* annotation to define steps. The string in the argument will appear later in the test report. You can use the variable *{n}* which will be replaced with the n-th argument the method is called with.

#### HTML test report

After running all the test, Serenity generates a HTML test report. On its homepage, the report offers a nice pie chart showing the test results of each feature category. The following image shows how this diagram currently looks like in our project.

{% image blog/blog-rat-serenity-results.png %}

We try to work test-driven, therefore there are a few test cases in a *pending* state (To do that, Serentity offers a @Pending annotation).
These tests are already written but will be skipped since the features they should test are not yet implemented. As soon as everything is in place, they can be activated.

You can click on a feature to see what kind of test cases are there. Each test case can consist of multiple steps which can be displayed in detail:

{% image blog/blog-rat-serenity-results-slideshow.png %}

In this test case we want to check if an image that was uploaded for a product is appearing in the product slideshow. The first step gives us a DemoShop (which can be newly craeted or was already used in other read-only test cases). The we take the first product from the product collection resource (*GET /products*) and upload the image. Finally we retrieve the product slideshow (*GET /products/{productId}/slideshow*) and check if the uploaded image is in there.



## Summary

RAT allows us to check the complete state of the REST API on an abritrary ePages installation just at the push of a button. We use it to partly automate our QA process and run it as last step of a developer installation via Jenkins to make sure everything went fine. RAT takes over repetitive tasks and guarantees a certain level of quality - we can spend the saved time on improving our test infrastructure and on the implementation of further test cases.

Currently we discuss how to include RAT in the Jenkins job that checks our pull requests GitHub. The challenge here is to choose the RAT branch that corresponds with the changes in the branch from the pull request.
