Last friday, we hosted the seventh edition of the Search Technology Meetup Hamburg organized by [Shopping24](https://www.shopping24.de) in our new building in Holstenwall 5.
The room was packed and participants from all kinds of backgrounds engaged in discussions with the invited speakers even before the presentations started.
Next to some snacks and refreshing drinks, we then saw two insightful talks on search architecture and how to use statistical as well as machine learning models for improving search.
Therefore, [Miguel Olivares](https://twitter.com/moliware) and Christian W√ºrtz from [Xing](https://www.xing.com/) as well as Data Scientist [Andrew Clegg](https://twitter.com/andrew_clegg) from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) gave us interesting insights into their search technology infrastructure, respectively.

## Evolution of search at Xing

At the social networking site for professionals Xing the search infrastructure plays a mayor role - from simple full text search on products up to an internal geo location service.
The speakers explained how they evolutionized Xing's search arquitecture and how they solved arising challenges in order to create their current infrastructure.
A technology that considerably contributed to its success was the Lucene-based search engine [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/de/products/elasticsearch).

## Search meets Data Science at Etsy

In his talk, Data Scientist Andrew Clegg introduced to us the challenges Etsy.com, the marketplace for unique items and creative goods, faces with regards to search and recommendation due to the variety in inventory.
The uniqueness of many of the offered items on Etsy adds on to this difficulty.
The Data Science team at Etsy, as part of the broader Search Science Group, consequently dedicates its work towards improving the outcome of items that people will love and works at the intersection of search and machine learning.
Andrew Clegg, thus, introduced Etsy's search technology stack and ran through a few remarkable and humorous examples that showed how Etsy was able to improve the search by using statistical and machine learning models.
Andrew pointed out how challenging it can be to bring together search engineering and machine learning, since dealing with taxonomies surely is a well-known concept for search engineers, yet not so much for data scientists.
Consequently, it is crucial to consider semantic similarity concepts and Andrew presented some of Etsy's use cases and how to measure similarity.
