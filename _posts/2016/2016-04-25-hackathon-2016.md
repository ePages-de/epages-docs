Another year, another ePages hackathon.
Spring is a nice season for hackdays, isn't it?
The world comes alive, the days are longer, and our developers have even more energy... for coding {% emoji wink %}!

This year's hackathon should focus on app development.
Now that this was clear, we started to collect more detailed topics and built individual teams.
The Scrum Masters addressed all manner of things associated with the hackathon organisation:
Meeting rooms had to be booked, working spaces to be coordinated, snacks and beverages to be organised, as well as the final topics had to be agreed.

And finally, it was time for the colleagues from Jena and Barcelona to travel to ePages headquarter in Hamburg.
Prior to the event itself, some developers met in bars or clubs in Hamburg to outline their ideas, or prepare their GitHub repositories.

Well, and also the challenge of feeding developers glued to their computers isnâ€™t a small one.
Thankfully, tons of crisps, and cookies as well as pizza and lemonade helped to focus on the tough tasks they came to solve, while still having the energy to take breaks and clear their heads.

## Ship it!

After much weaving of code and pushing of pixels, and simply having a great time together, the teams presented their projects.
The audience was highly impressed by those well-prepared presentations and all those fairly polished results.
We saw native Android apps, developed in Java, cross-platform apps for Android and iOS, done with Ionic Framework or React Native, as well as Web apps.
Next to this, some teams focused on other projects, like a REST cache layer or a complexity measuring tool or preparing ...
