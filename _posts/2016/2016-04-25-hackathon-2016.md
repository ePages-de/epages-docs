Another year, another ePages hackathon.
Spring is a nice season for hacking, isn't it?
The world comes alive, the days are longer, and our developers have even more energy... for coding {% emoji wink %}!

This year's hackathon focused on app development.

Finally, it was time for the colleagues from Jena and Barcelona to travel to ePages headquarters in Hamburg.

Prior to the event itself, some developers met in bars or clubs in Hamburg to outline their ideas, or prepare their GitHub repositories.

The following 36 hours then consisted of three main activities: hacking, teamwork, and fun.
The challenge of feeding developers glued to their computers isnâ€™t a small one.
Thankfully, tons of crisps, cookies, pizza, and lemonade helped to focus on the tough tasks they came to solve.

## Ship it!

After much weaving of code and pushing of pixels while having a great time together the teams presented their projects.
The audience was highly impressed by those well-prepared presentations and all those polished results.

We saw native Android apps developed in Java, cross-platform apps for Android and iOS done with Ionic Framework or React Native, as well as Web apps.
Meanwhile, some teams focused on other projects, like a REST cache layer, or a complexity measuring tool, or preparing ...
