# code.talks 2016 - popcorn, nachos and code at Kampnagel

The code talks 2016 


# Highlights

## The Return of Sanity? (Die RÃ¼ckkehr der Vernunft?)

The conference started with a real highlight on the main stage in K6 - [Lars Jankowfsky](https://twitter.com/dodgeris) and [Johann-Peter Hartmann](https://twitter.com/Johannhartmann) gave a talked about *"The Return of Sanity?" ("Die RÃ¼ckkehr der Vernunft?")*. Their talk was a discussion between the two about which technology stack to use for their imaginary starup *canab.io*. This was a very entertaining sequence of bashing hot programming languages.

The point Lars and Johann tried to make was that developers often choose technologies because they are interested to learn them and not by experience and profound knowledge.

The sponsor often has different goals. The choosen technology should scale and it should be possible to find skilled people on the market. Also they do not want to be dependent on a certain technology and it should leverage fast time to market.

So their appeal was to choose technology more scientifically and not based on hype - they asked everybody to decide as if you have *"skin in the game"*. Which technology would you choose if the south italian investor captured your family and will just release them if the project is develivered in time.

## Developing more efficiently with functional Programming

[Michael Sperber](https://twitter.com/sperbsen) from Active Group talked about functional programming. He took an example based approach to show how useful the main principles of functional programming are. Particularly creative examples are unbeaten

He showed how pure functional programming can also be applied in UI development by giving a few examples in [Reacl](https://github.com/active-group/reacl) - a ClojureScript library for programming with the React framework.
