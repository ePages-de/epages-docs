## The party

{% image blog/blog-codetalks2016-vouchers.jpg 50% right %}

After the first day of talks everybody was invited to have fun at the code.talks After-Work-Party, which conveniently took place at Kampnagel as well.
And because it also started to rain it was even more attractive to stay and continue with networking while having some drinks.
All the speakers where supplied with a batch of vouchers for free drinks and happily gave them out to the thirsty community.
There was not only a DJ responsible for the perfect mix of music, but he was also accompanied by a live saxophone player who received a lot of cheers.


## Our talk

Just before lunch on Friday it was time for Oliver and Jens to give their talk on modern Java Frameworks.
The Alabama Cinema at Kampnagel served as their stage, and although it was a bit separated from all the other conference rooms it was still well visited.
The talk was delivered as a amusing discussion between Bob Operator and Joe Developer while implementing a new feature live on stage into an existing online pizza shop based on Java microservices.
Showing best practices and introducing a number of useful Open Source libraries was very well received by the audience.
Source code for the epizza project can be found on the [ePages GitHub account](https://github.com/ePages-de/epizza).
The presentation ended with lots of laughter when a real pizza delivery boy carrying steaming hot salami pizza entered the cinema and asking who ordered it - proof that the implementation really worked ;-)

## Highlights

### The Return of Sanity? (Die RÃ¼ckkehr der Vernunft?)

The conference started with a real highlight on the main stage in K6 - [Lars Jankowfsky](https://twitter.com/dodgeris) and [Johann-Peter Hartmann](https://twitter.com/Johannhartmann) gave a talked about *"The Return of Sanity?" ("Die RÃ¼ckkehr der Vernunft?")*. Their talk was a discussion between the two about which technology stack to use for their imaginary starup *canab.io*. This was a very entertaining sequence of bashing hot programming languages.

The point Lars and Johann tried to make was that developers often choose technologies because they are interested to learn them and not by experience and profound knowledge.

The sponsor often has different goals. The choosen technology should scale and it should be possible to find skilled people on the market. Also they do not want to be dependent on a certain technology and it should leverage fast time to market.

So their appeal was to choose technology more scientifically and not based on hype - they asked everybody to decide as if you have *"skin in the game"*. Which technology would you choose if the south italian investor captured your family and will just release them if the project is develivered in time.

### Developing more efficiently with functional Programming

[Michael Sperber](https://twitter.com/sperbsen) from Active Group talked about functional programming. He took an example based approach to show how useful the main principles of functional programming are. Particularly creative examples are unbeaten

He showed how pure functional programming can also be applied in UI development by giving a few examples in [Reacl](https://github.com/active-group/reacl) - a ClojureScript library for programming with the React framework.
