Great news at the beginning of the new year: we are happy to announce that the ePages REST API is now officially out of beta!
During 2015 we made great progress in the development of new REST calls which you can now use to create great apps.

With our REST API, you can build apps and expand the ePages App Store with new features.
This helps enrich our merchants shop administration.

## Put your idea into action

Sign up for the ePages Developer Program with just a few clicks.
Read further [here](page:apps-overview#registration) and receive all required information on the registration.

## Use cases

We've put together some [use cases](page:apps-use-cases) that describe business scenarios that you might want to take a look at.
Maybe that inspires you and gives some further insight of what kind of apps we're currently looking for.

## Integrations

Take a glance at our integrations.
There's already a [Ruby gem](page:apps-ruby-gem) in place that is to help you create easy and understandable code and speed up your development.

Using our [REST client SITe](https://github.com/ePages-de/site) you can easily build a plugin for a Content Management System (CMS) or blog of your choice.

## We're keeping you up to date

We've implemented a change log that covers significant updates and changes to the ePages REST API.
In order to keep track of these changes we recommend you to follow [@epagesdevs](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs) on Twitter or subscribe to our [RSS feed for the API Change Log](https://developer.epages.com/apps/feed.xml).

## Happy coding!

We're excited to have your app in the ePages App Store soon!
