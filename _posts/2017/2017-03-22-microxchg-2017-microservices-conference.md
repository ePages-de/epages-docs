# MicroXchg 2017 - Microservices conference in Berlin

At mid of February the [microXchg conference](http://microxchg.io) took place.
It is the biggest two day event in Europe that focuses on Microservices - an architectural design of software systems that has generated a lot of traction within the last years as it is capable of transforming SOA and monolith systems.

## Warm-Up Meetup

One day before the Microservices Meetup Berlin made a plenum discussions with the greatest influencers in Microservices possible.
Although I learned not really something new totally new, there where quite a lot of more details.
Escpecially Fred George's tellings of histories of his life and big big software projects were worth every second I could spend sitting in the first row.

## Workshop Day

I visited the workshop building microservcies with Scala and Akka by [Yaroslav Tkachenko](http://sap1ens.com).
It was an awesome experience.
He is a highly skilled professional with a very long background in Scala and prepared a workshop that could have easily spanned two more days.

The material until the very last seconds of the workshop visited the conference as well [afterwards](http://sap1ens.com/blog/2017/02/26/microxchg-2017), where we had many interesting discussions about the tech communities in Canada.

All talks where recorded with 4 microphones, a whole study setup and 3 cameras and uploaded directly afterwards.
You can find them here and here.

As you can tell the speaker lineup was incredible and the talks absolutly stunning.
The atmosphere throught very single moment was  so much filled with energy it was amazing – the very best conference within my life of visting conferences, which I stopped counting at 50 conferences.

The orga team was a blast as well and I was honoroued to be part of extedned orgacrew and could really help making this experience happen and interview some of the top noch speakers.

Thanks for such great days. I will never forget this event in my life!
