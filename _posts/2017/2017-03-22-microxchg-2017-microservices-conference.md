# MicroXchg 2017 - Microservices conference in Berlin

At mid of February the [microXchg conference](http://microxchg.io) took place in Berlin.
It is the biggest two day event in Europe that focuses on Microservices - an architectural design of software systems that has generated a lot of traction within the last years as it is capable of transforming SOA and monolith systems.

## Kickoff Conference Panel - on evening before

One day before the [Microservices Meetup Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Microservices-Meetup-Berlin/) held a [conference panel](https://www.meetup.com/Microservices-Meetup-Berlin/events/237309001/) event with a plenum discussions.
Invited were some of the greatest influencers in Microservices these days: Uwe Friedrichsen, Oliver Gierke, Eberhard Wolff and Fred George.
Although I learned not really something new totally new, there where quite a lot of more details.
Especially Fred's tellings of histories of his life and big, big software projects were worth every second I could spend sitting in the first row.
I also had the opportunity to ask questions and chat with participants.

## Workshop Day

I visited the workshop building microservcies with Scala and Akka by [Yaroslav Tkachenko](http://sap1ens.com).
It was an awesome experience.
He is a highly skilled professional with a very long background in Scala and prepared a workshop that could have easily spanned two more days.

The material until the very last seconds of the workshop visited the conference as well [afterwards](http://sap1ens.com/blog/2017/02/26/microxchg-2017), where we had many interesting discussions about the tech communities in Canada.

## Visited Talks

I could visit a lot of interesting sessions with a wide variety of topics.
All talks where recorded with 4 microphones, 3 cameras in each room.
The movie crew also had 2 setup setups on sight with 8 monitors.
They could make professional movie cuts of the talks directly after the talks.
Just 30 minutes after a talk was finished it was uploaded directly into familiar movie services.
You can find them on the [microXchg YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGCbB8TPtYMQmJwYVogcPjg).
And also on [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/microxchg), which is one of the best platform for tech talks on the internet as slides and speaker recordings are presented in two windows.
As you can watch all recordings there I will only give a summary on one single talk

## Summary

As you can tell the speaker lineup was incredible and the talks absolutly stunning.
The atmosphere throught very single moment was  so much filled with energy it was amazing – the very best conference within my life of visting conferences, which I stopped counting at 50 conferences.

The orga team was a blast as well and I was honoroued to be part of extended orgacrew.
I am really happy that I could help to make this conference a great experience and also interview some of the top speakers.

Thanks for such terrific days in Berlin. I will never forget this event in my life!

Thanks also for the delicious catering and many discussion.
