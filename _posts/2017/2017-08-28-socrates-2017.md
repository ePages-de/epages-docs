What happens if you gather approximately 250 people at one place for four days, provide them with shelter, food and drinks?
They might play beach volleyball, teach music theory, jam, dance, explore stoicism, guide each other through our galaxy, play board games, perform magic tricks, improve their handwriting, talk about inclusion and taste proper tea and coffee.
If those people would additionally all care about well-crafted software, you might call this gathering a [**So**ftware **Cra**ftsmanship and **Tes**ting Conference](https://www.socrates-conference.de/).

# SoCraTes 2017

The SoCraTes is an open space conference meaning there is no upfront agenda: All sessions are provided by the participants based on personal experience, preference, skills and demand.
The organizers provide a room-timeslot-matrix

(see header image to get an idea)

The conference experience is highly individual since you cannot visit all sessions and are free to switch sessions at any time ("Law of Two Feet").

So here I want to share what I took home from the SoCraTes 2017.

so if you always wanted to learn about TDD, mob programming and practice some katas, you are at the right place.

## What I learned

### ... for my craft

* Compilers (refresh + sharing knowledge)
* Pair programming interviews (with Raimo), fixing hiring
  * Be aware of Raimo's context: (junior/intermediate/senior developer positions, small/big companies, no complex domain)
  * Offer candidate a pair programming session or take-home exercise
  * Write a detailed email to the candidate beforehand:
    * Introduce yourself
    * Outline the task, used frameworks
    * Ask special needs (e.g. dietary restrictions)
    * We will provide you with a development machine, but if you prefer you can bring your own device (look at the candidate's development setup)
  * Try to make it a pleasant experience, ask them beforehand if they feel fit enough (similar to an exam)
  * Relevancy of the exercise (task similar to production tasks the team is solving or subset of production code) - DELETE the code afterwards due to legal reasons!
  * Suggestion: 3rd person in the room (observer?) PROS: less stress on navigator evaluating the candidate, CONS: awkward and maybe more stressful for the candidate
  * Suggestion: Mob programming if job is more stressful in general (e.g. consulting)
  * Time frame: 1-2h, but stop early if you see the candidate suffers --> don't hire
  * On the actual pairing: seniors need to lead, point direction, asking questions and communicate clearly
  * Open rejection up to debate, let the candidate reason his decisions
  * No scam tasks or trick questions! No grilling!
  * But play "devils advocate" once a while, candidate needs to be able to argument reasons
  * Maybe offer to lower the bar (e.g. applying junior instead of intermediate criteria)
  * Have a retro + give feedback! Ask for feedback, offer a private channel, too
* [Medium Interview Handbook (series of blog posts)](https://medium.engineering/mediums-engineering-interview-process-b8d6b67927c4)
  * We especially disected the [grading criteria](https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f)
* Vim patterns
* Git CLI
  * Meld and the git CLI have an option to ignore whitespace when showing the diff
  * Never change whitespace / formatting in a feature branch / PR
  * Fixup commits
  * zsh provides autocompletion for git hashes (but you should be using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/q) anyway)
* State Kata
* How do you introduce new languages for microservices at your company?
* Toxic team dynamics <---> Awesome team patterns
* Visualizing code
* Inclusion
* CircuitBreaker
* QuickCheck
* Microservice intro, microservice testing
* Fishshell
* Container orchestration
* Elixir
* Beam - Erlang / Elixir VM
  * Beam is more like an operating system, it assigns processes (Erlang functions) to schedulers
  * Messages are copied from the source to the target process, no shared memory
  * You can link processes, meaning if one of the linked processes dies, all linked (even the indirectly linked ones) processes die
  * Supervisors can restart died processes
  * You can harness this failure-recover method for real business use-cases. Ignore error handling and focus on core business logic
* Cloud IDEs, cloud development setup
* [Awesome intro to functional programming and monads](https://github.com/FaustXVI/functional-programming-introduction/tree/playing)

Softer topics:

* Software career paths
* How to become an expert
* Are you doing bad Scrum?
* Taking over responsibility
* Personal Kanban
  * Eisenhower Matrix
  * Max. 2 things in "Doing"
  * Inbox zero
  * Retro: Good/bad tasks, flow
* About our craft
* Home alone (working as a freelancer from home)
* Communication in development teams
* Mentoring
* [Mob Programming RPG by Willem Larsen](https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg/) (Fizzbuzz Kata)
  * Exercise to teach good practices and behavior for mob programming
  * For best effect: choose team that does not know mob programming, don't tell it's mob programming
  * When leveling up make some sound like "kaashingg", this adds to the fun and serves as an indicator to the group, when certain behavior resulted in a level-up
* Writing a book
  * Leanpub.com, Softcover.io, Kindle direct, CreateSpace
  * write with colleagues, write for yourself, write something you would read yourself, 300 words/day
  * If you are non-native speaker and write in English without an editor you will sound like an idiot to native speakers
  * Choose the right publisher for your book (is your book long lasting? are recurring editions expected?)
  * Be careful with US-American publishers, if you are behind schedule, they will assign another author to finish the book, replacing you
  * Publisher asks questions and gives feedback beforehand on your ideas

### ... for life

* If you want to see something in the dark, don't focus on the object you want to see but on the area around it
* Algol is the "devils advocate" -> only "blinking star" you can see with the bare eye, this is because what we see are actually two stars rotating around each other
  -> the visible blink effect is due to the Earth's atmosphere
*

Life hacks go here:

Observation:

* All very sociable
* People like teaching / mentoring
