We just came back from beautiful Barcelona where the Spring I/O took place for the 6th time. 
Spring I/O is the leading european conference focused on the Spring Framework ecosystem. 
This year it was all about the upcoming Spring 5 and its support for Reactive programming.

Here are some of our highlights from this year's edition if Spring  I/O:

## Reactive Spring

This talk started the second day of the conference. 
Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) and [Mark Heckler](http://twitter.com/mkheck) gave an introduction to the reactive features in Spring 5 in a live-coding heavy session.
And everybody who ever attended to see a talk by infamous Josh Long knew what was coming.

Their talk gave a very good introduction about how Spring 5 is supporting reactive programming, building on Project Reactor to support message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services.
They showed how to expose reactive endpoints using the traditional annotated controller approach but also the new functional way using `RouterFunction` and ``HandlerFunction`.
