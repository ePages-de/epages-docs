The technology and e-commerce expert, [Harm Behrens](https://www.epages.com/de/unternehmen/newsroom/news/Harm-Behrens-ist-neuer-CTO-bei-ePages.php), joined [ePages](https://www.epages.com/de/) as CTO in November 2014.
Ever since ePages benefits from Harm's over 15 years of expertise in the field of development and operation of extensive web and mobile applications.
In this interview, Harm talks about the next generation commerce platform, about his daily Latte Macchiato as well as his focus on people, directions, and technology.

### Harm, you have been working at ePages for two years now. Back then, you were hired to take charge of the advancement of the ePages platform. What has happened in these two years?

Quite a lot.
It's true that I've been hired to push forward our new software architecture for ePages.
Yet, it's also true that the scope of my work is much broader than that.
Roughly, I am taking care of three main areas concerning our product portfolio strategy and development:

1. Refining, enhancing and adding value to our current core shop software: ePages 6
2. Developing an improved version of ePages 6 concerning usability and the new design of the storefront: [ePages Now](https://www.epages.com/de/now/).
3. Advancing the development of our very latest online shop software: ePages BEYOND.

ePages 6 is our very first and core product, which has a wide range of features and functionalities that our customers highly appreciate.
Over the past two years, we extended and enhanced ePages 6 with the [REST API](https://developer.epages.com/apps).
Consequently, we facilitated an App Store as well as a [Theme Store](https://themes.epages.com/en/).

Only then, we integrated [ePages Now](https://www.epages.com/de/now/) through the REST API and launched the product by the end of last year.

### Tell me more about ePages Now.

Well, it is basically a new storefront that is up-to-date considering responsiveness and a variety of themes.
The modernized usability of the administration area allows the merchant to arrange items by drag and drop, as for example, content pages, landing pages, and alike.
Yet, the shop software is still based on the ePages 6 architecture.

Before I could start to busily push forward our new product ePages BEYOND, I had to consider a handful of other issues.
For example, I gave the impetus to establish our Hamburg office as developer location.
Before that we had only a few developers here, the rest of them worked in Jena.
So, in fact, one of my primary tasks since 2014 was to recruit developers to assure the further development of ePages Now as well as to start off with our new e-commerce platform ePages BEYOND.
I also restructured some teams and together with the team members we determined their focus.
Consequently, we now have several development teams dedicating their work to focus on ePages 6, ePages Now, and ePages BEYOND.

### How did you come up with the idea of ePages Now - a product with improved usability?

ePages Now was an existing project, even before I started at ePages.
In this respect, it is not my own creation.
Before I joined ePages, the company went through a reorganization from a rather waterfall oriented method of development to an agile one.
However, I then took over the responsibility to further improve and align the goals of the ePages Now project.

### What are the goals of ePages BEYOND?

The new platform pursues three main goals:

1. Deploy modern technologies, e.g. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana), and alike.
2. Establish an architecture based on [microservices](http://microservices.io/) instead of monoliths to circumvent dependencies.
3. Ensure scalability of the new platform - as we're working across cities and countries.

With ePages BEYOND we obtain these three goals.
We deploy Java, make use of microservices and rolled out a blueprint approach in order to scale our platform across our three different locations.
Besides continually evolving BEYOND, we also created a template that cuts down complexity and thus makes it easier for new teams to work on the project.
Furthermore, we developed a prototype and determined to use a [greenfield](http://aimblog.uoregon.edu/2015/06/30/benefits-of-the-greenfield-approach/#.WFOW_OHhBTY) approach.
Our two teams - Team Black in Hamburg and Team White in Jena - currently dedicate all their work towards ePages BEYOND and thus already prove the software's scalability.

To sum it all up, what we achieved during the last two years was to hire new developers, determine our teams' focus, facilitate an App Store as well as Theme Store for ePages Now, integrate a valuable REST API in order to integrate ePages Now, and finally lay the foundation for our newest product, BEYOND.

### Where does the development of ePages BEYOND stand today and where are you heading to?

We've already developed an excellent prototype.
Our objective is to finish this prototype by the end of February 2017.

One point that is still very important to me is a completely automated process to ensure that code changes are quickly launched.
It's basically about finding a way to easily and timely release changes - this means only a few code lines instead of plenty.

Consequently, it also becomes easier to identify and fix bugs.
This automation process is what we're currently working on.
We found great support by our Application Management team.

Working in the cloud is also a big topic for me.
It remarkably facilitates scalability.
Thus, our Sales and Business Development team can introduce the product to our customers already at an early stage.
Also, we're aiming to develop even more features for ePages BEYOND.
You see, we always strive forward.

### Besides these new software platforms, what else are you responsible for?

Honestly, my work consists of quite a lot of human resources work.
We place great value on finding the right employees and establishing a corresponding culture.
We cherish a company culture that employs great people, that has an international working atmosphere and that challenges our employees.

I receive great support from HR in this regard.
Together, we redesigned the whole process of tech recruiting at ePages.
For instance, we introduced [Codility] (https://codility.com/) tests.
Potential candidates have to solve a small coding challenge in advance.
This way, we get a first hint about their programming skills.

During the whole recruiting process, the future team colleagues are closely involved, because we want to ensure good team work.
We often provide another coding challenge and ask our candidate to put it on GitHub and make a pull request.
Finally, I always like to get to know the candidates in person to see whether the interpersonal aspect fits as well.
All in all, we reduced a lot of uncertainties with our improved recruiting process.

We also implemented a peer review feedback via [impraise](http://www.impraise.com/) to ensure continuous improvement and employee feedback.

### Certainly there is more...?

Well yes.
I pushed forward the implementation of our developer blog, as I noticed the lack of employer branding at ePages.
The teams alternate with writing tech stories that are related to their work every month using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
This way, and by introducing our [epagesdevs](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs) Twitter account, we now ensure that job applicants have a first idea of our work and our recruiting process.

To sum it up in one sentence:
I dedicate my time to issues that call for improvement.

### What does a typical working day look like?

In the morning it takes me about 35 minutes to cycle to work.
I always enjoy the bike ride along the beautiful Elbe to distract myself a bit.
When arriving at ePages, I go through all offices to say "Hi" to everyone and eventually quickly clarify pending tasks or uncertainties.
I then switch on my computer and check new emails.
During the day I try to attend as many team reviews as possible, even if it's from remote.

Furthermore, I attempt to keep myself up-to-date on the latest technology trends and news.
My work basically consists of the following three aspects: people, directions, and technology.
I regularly have lunch with different teams.
Also, I have meetings with the teams to ensure that there is room for everyone to proactively approach me with ideas, concerns or whatsoever.
I am in permanent exchange with HR and my colleague who is in charge for the development teams in Jena.
Therefore, I try to visit the Jena office every two months and our Barcelona office every three to four months.
Hmmm, and I don't want to forget to mention the many Latte Macchiatos I have throughout the day {% emoji wink %}.

### What are the most important aspects when working with different development teams?

Open and honest communication!
I appreciate it a lot if employees approach me to make suggestions for further proceedings and improvements.
Sometimes it's challenging for me to immerse myself in all subject areas.
The development teams that work on their tasks day-to-day have a deeper understanding of challenges than I and thus can make hands-on proposals.
This is also what I expect from the teams: to work autonomously, take on responsibility, and be self-organized.

### Which programming languages and technologies do you mainly work with?

Still a lot of Perl - simply because that's the code base of ePages 6.
This is changing a bit due to ePages Now.
It's new storefront and the editor use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
We use Java for our API and [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) for our search engine.
Supporting tools are Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

### What do you like most about ePages?

ePages allows for everyone to proactively contribute and shape the topics we we deal with.
One can work autonomously and with great responsibility.
The company culture creates a friendly and collaborative atmosphere - people enjoy working at ePages.
Personally, I think I could have a chat over a beer with every single ePagee.
I simply enjoy being in the office and around my colleagues.

### Can you give me a future outlook on what will happen next?

Last year we launched ePages Now.
For 2017, we will have to shift more resources to ePages BEYOND.
This will be this year's challenge.
Also, we will see, if we are able to assert our position in the US-market.

### Thanks Harm, for the interview. It was very insightful chatting with you.
