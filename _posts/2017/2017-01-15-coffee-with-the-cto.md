The technology and e-commerce expert, [Harm Behrens](https://www.epages.com/de/unternehmen/newsroom/news/Harm-Behrens-ist-neuer-CTO-bei-ePages.php), took over the CTO position at the internationally leading online shop software provider [ePages](https://www.epages.com/de/) in November 2014.
Ever since ePages benefits from Harm's over 15 years of expertise in the field of development and operation of extensive web and mobile applications.
In this interview, Harm talks about the next generation commerce platform, about his daily Latte Macchiato as well as his focus on people, directions and technology.

## Harm, you have been working at ePages for two years now. Back then, you were hired to take charge of the advancement of the ePages platform. What has happened in these two years?

It has happened quite a lot.
First of all, we tried to establish our Hamburg office location as a developer location, too.
Before that, there were only a few developers working in our Hanseatic office, but mainly in Jena.
Secondly, we intended to obtain a few "quick wins" concerning our old product.
After all, this took us two years, because we needed to keep on track refining our old shop software to add value and benefits for our customers.
You see, it was not only about the new software or keeping the old software running, but rather about extending and improving the old software by the Java API.
Consequently, we facilitated an app store as well as a theme store.
Only then, we integrated the new shop software [ePages Now](https://www.epages.com/de/now/) through an API and the result is what we see now - it's now on the market.

## Tell me more about ePages Now!

ePages Now is the latest product we launched to the market by the end of last year.
It is basically a new store-front that is up-to-date considering responsiveness and selecting one's desired template.
The modernized usability of the back-office allows the merchant to arrange items by drag and drop, as for example, content pages, landing pages, and alike.
The starting point for all this was the Java API through which we were able to integrate an app store, a theme store and to integrate ePages Now.

So, really, my main task since 2014 was to recruit new developers and assure the further development of our former product as well as to push ahead our new product ePages Now and ultimately drive forward our very latest architecture, which will be launched this year.
Also, I restructured teams and we determined their focus.
At the beginning, there was a team that was supposed to work on the new architecture.
Yet, in day-to-day business it turned out that they were busier fixing bugs of the old software than focussing on the new one.
Consequently, we set up our senior developer's team that now only dedicates its work towards the new architecture.

The new platform pursues three main goals:

1. Deploy modern technologies, e.g. Java instead of monoliths to circumvent dependences
2. Establish an architecture based on [microservices](http://microservices.io/)
3. Ensure scalability of the new platform - as we're working across cities and countries

With our new platform, BEYOND, we achieve these three goals.
We deploy Java, make use of microservices and rolled out a blueprint approach in order to scale our platform across our three different locations.
We don't only develop further our new software, but also we created a template that cuts down complexity and thus makes it easier for new teams to work on the project.

To sum it all up, what we achieved during the last two years was to hire new developers, find the focus for our teams, integrate a valuable API, an app store, a theme store and alike to our old product and lay the foundation for our new product.
For our new product we developed a theme, a prototype and determined to use a [greenfield](http://aimblog.uoregon.edu/2015/06/30/benefits-of-the-greenfield-approach/#.WFOW_OHhBTY) approach.
Our senior teams - team black in Hamburg and team white in Jena - currently dedicate their work towards our new product and thus already prove the shop software's scalability.

## How did you come up with the idea of ePages Now - a product with improved usability?

ePages Now was an existing project, even before I started at ePages.
In this respect, it is not my own creation.
Before I came, the company went through a reorganization from a rather waterfall oriented method of development to an agile one.
However, I then took over the responsibility to further improve and align the goals of the ePages Now project.

## Where does the development of the new architecture stand today and where are you heading to?

We've already developed a excellent prototype.
Our objective is to finish it by the end of Feburary 2017.

One point that is still very important to me considering the development process, is to completely automate it to ensure that code changes are quickly launched.
It's basically about finding a way to easily and timely release changes - this means only a few code lines, instead of plenty.

Consequently, it also becomes easier to identify and fix code bugs.
This automation is what we are working on and we found great support by the Application Management team.
Working in the cloud already facilitates scalability remarkably.
Thus, our Sales and Business Development team can run testings with our customers at an early stage of the product.
Also, we're aiming to develop even more features for our new architecture.
You notice, we always strive forward.

## Besides the new architecture, what else are you responsible for?

Honestly, my work consists of quite a lot of human resource work.
We place great value on finding the right people and establishing a corresponding culture.
We cherish a company culture that employs great people, has an international working atmosphere and that challenges our employees.

I get great support from HR in this aspect.
Together, we redesigned the whole process of tech recruiting at ePages.
Therefore, we introduced for instance codility tests.
So, potential candidates have to solve a small programming challenge in advance.
This way, we get a first hint about their programming skills.

During the whole recruiting process, the future team colleagues are closely involved, because we want to ensure good team work.
We often provide another coding challenge and want our candidate to put it on GitHub and make a pull request.
Finally, I always like to get to know them in person to see whether there is sympathy in human levels as well.
All in all, we reduced a lot of uncertainties with our improved recruiting process.

We also implemented a peer review framework with the platform [impraise](http://www.impraise.com/) to secure continuous improvement and feedback.
Another example of what I do besides pushing the new architecture, is the implementation of a developer blog as we started to notice the lack of employer branding at ePages.
Each team contributes with an article every two months using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
This way, and by the realization of a developer [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs) account, we now ensure that job applicants have a first idea of our work and our recruiting process.

To sum it up in one sentence:
I dedicate my time to issues that call for improvement.

## What does a typical work day look like?

In the morning it takes me about 35 minutes to cycle to work.
I always enjoy the bike ride along the beautiful Elbe to distract myself a bit.
When arriving at ePages, I go through all offices to say "Hi" to everyone and eventually quickly clarify pending tasks or uncertainties.
I then switch on my computer and check new e-mails.
During the day I try to attend as many team reviews as possible, even if it's remotely.

On the other hand, I attempt to keep myself up-dated on the latest technology trends and news.
My days and my work basically consists of the following three aspects: people, directions and technology.
I regularly have lunch with different teams.
Also, I have meetings with the teams to ensure that there is room for everyone to proactively approach me with ideas, concerns or whatsoever.
I am in permanent exchange with HR and my colleague who is in charge for the developer teams in Jena.
Therefore, I try to be in Jena every two months and every three to four months in our office in Barcelona.
Lastly, I don't want to forget to mention my Latte Macchiatos throughout the day.

## What are the most important aspects to you when working with the different developer teams?

Open and honest communication!
I appreciate it a lot, when teams approach me to make suggestions for further proceeding and improvements.
Sometimes it's challenging for me to immerse myself in all subject areas.
The developer teams that work on their task day-to-day have a deeper understanding of challenges than I and can, thus, make hands-on proposals.
This is also what I expect from my colleagues: to work autonomously, take on responsibility and be self-organized.

## Which programming languages and technologies do you mainly work with?

Still a lot of Perl - simply because this is the system currently implemented by our customers.
This is changing due to ePages Now, which implements a new store-front and a new editor using React.
We use Java for our API and Solr for our search-engine.
As mentioned before, BEYOND is our new shop architecture.
Supporting tools are Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

## What do you like most about ePages?

ePages allows for everyone to proactively contribute and shape the topics we work at.
One can work autonomously and with great responsibility.
The firm culture creates a friendly and collaborative atmosphere - people enjoy working at ePages.
Personally, I think I could have a chat over a beer with every single one of my colleagues.
I simply enjoy being in the office and around my colleagues.

## Can you give me a future outlook on what will happen next?

Last year we launched our new shop software ePages Now.
For this year, we will have to see how to shift our resources to our newest product BEYOND.
This will be this year's challenge.
Also, we will see, if we are able to assert our position in the US-market.
