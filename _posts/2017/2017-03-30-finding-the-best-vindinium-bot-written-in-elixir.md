This Tuesday, the second part of the [hh.ex vindinium challenge](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Elixir-Hamburg/events/238421135/?eventId=238421135) took place in the [ePages](https://www.epages.com/en/) office in Hamburg.
Despite the amazing weather conditions outside, there were quite a few [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [vindinium](http://vindinium.org/) interested developers to join the meetup.


## Programming a semi static blogengine with Elixir

The event started off with a presentation about our developer Erik's side project to create a semi static blogengine called Jelly Shot.

The idea to set up this blogengine with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) came up, because he found that working with the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) often takes up too much time.
Motivated to immerse in the world of [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), he thought it couldn't be too difficult to write his own blogengine.
And he was absolutely right!

His blogengine Jelly Shot uses the web-framework [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) and is written in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).
Unlike other blog systems, Jelly Shot has no access to databases nor uses static file generation, but stores data in its memory.
The agent administers all data and is able to filter, delete, or replace parts of it - and this at a much faster pace.

## The grand hh.ey vindinium challenge tournament

After a short break to tank up new energy with a few snacks and drinks, everyone was ready to join or watch the vindinium show.
Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge, in which the players have to take control of a legendary hero fighting for the land of Vindinium using their favorite programming language.
In this case, there were three competitors who programmed their heroes with the functional language Elixir and the forth player was a random bot.
The participants got really engaged with the four legendary heroes slashing goblins and stealing gold mines.

Everyone watched the screen with excitement to see which of the legendary heroes would collect the most gold to win the game.

The meetup itself was a great way to spark discussions on the participants' experiences and faced challenges with the functional language Elixir. Thanks again for the great organization!
