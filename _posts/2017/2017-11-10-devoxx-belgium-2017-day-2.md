Second day.
It will be hard to top the first day, but the agenda is promising again.
Read on what my schedule looked like on Thursday, and what the talks were like (imho).

## Lazy Java

To start the day, [Mario Fusco](https://twitter.com/mariofusco) talked about how you could introduce more lazy
evaluation in your Java code, mainly by using lambdas.
While the content was quite good, the presentation wasn't. Maybe looking at the slides only might be a better use
of your time.

## gRPC vs REST: let the battle begin!

With [Alex Borysov](https://twitter.com/aiborisov) being the gRPC advocate and
[Mykyta Protsenko](https://twitter.com/mykyta_p) taking the REST part, this was a good session.
You could learn about the main characteristics of both styles, and where each of them have their strengths and
weaknesses. Worth watching.

## Going Reactive with Spring 5 & Project Reactor

Seeing [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) giving a presentation is always a highlight event, but this time he
was supported by [Mark Heckler](https://twitter.com/MkHeck).
Together they gave a really amazing introduction to reactive Spring.
This talk is highly recommended, and you might want to watch it even when not interested in the content, just for the
pure joy of watching a fantastic live coding show!

## Quickie: SOLID Principles for Cloud Native Containers

While [Bilgin Ibryam](https://twitter.com/bibryam) showed nothing fundamentally new, he very nicely summarized a lot
of best practices and good advice for working with Cloud Native containers in this 15 minutes quickie. Recommended!

## Quickie: Ally for Women in Technology

In this quickie, [Heather VanCura](https://twitter.com/heathervc) presented her top 10 things (mostly) man can do to
make the IT world a better place to work in by making it more welcoming to women.
IMHO, most of those top 10 should be mandatory to everyone, no matter if there are woman in your team or not.
If you're interested in this topic, these 15 minutes are worth viewing.
And if not, well... YOU SHOULD BE!

## Spring Boot 2.0 Web Applications

The second Spring talk of the day I visited was an introduction to the new features and paradigms of Spring Boot 2.0,
given by [Stéphane Nicoll](https://twitter.com/snicoll) and [Brian Clozel](https://twitter.com/bclozel).
Although this session could not keep up with the Josh Long talk with regards to entertainment, the content was also
quite good.
If you havn't had a deeper look at the new possibilities that come with Spring Boot 2.0, I would recommend this as a
good summary.

## How Events Are Reshaping Modern Systems

Akka inventor and Lightbend CTO [Jonas Bonér](https://twitter.com/jboner) gave his view on how event-driven architecture
solves a lot of problems software systems are facing nowadays.
Ranging from the general concepts of commands end events, touching actor-based systems (guess which one
{% emoji smile %}), to event sourcing, a lot of topics were covered.
Not unsurprisingly, the quality of this talk was really great, and it's really worth watching on Youtube!

## Container Orchestration Considerations

In this talk [Patrick van der Bleek](https://twitter.com/pvdbleek) from Docker tried to give an overview of the
considerations you need to make when taking Docker containers to production, i.e. how to orchestrate them.
Beginning with on overview of existing solutions, he afterwards focused on the two main players, Kubernetes and Swarm.
This is where the quality of the talk began to drop, as he was, imho, (natually) so strongly biased towards Swarm that
a lot of his comparisons were plainly misleading.
Altogether, if you're looking for an orchestration tool, you will still get some valuable input from this talk.
Just keep his bias in mind and also watch a talk from a Kubernetes advocate. {% emoji smile %}

## Common API security pitfalls

As the final talk of the second day, I selected [Philippe De Ryck](https://twitter.com/PhilippeDeRyck) presenting his
personal top 11 web application / API security fallacies.
Every developer providing web APIs should at least have a look at the slides, to make sure you know about the possible
weaknesses your API exposes.
Nice talk, not too challenging, and therefore a good fit for the end of the agenda for Thursday.

## Summary

To round up this day, which again had an amazing density of valuable information to me, the devoxxians were invited to
see [Blade Runner 2049](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/), which quite a lot did.
The movie made it a nice evening of a very long and exhausting day, which once again was really worth visiting the devoxx.
