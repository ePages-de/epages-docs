I've always liked interacting with people from other countries and cultures so the fact that ePages is an international
company was one of the reasons why I joined the crew in the first place. That was the beginning of my software developer
career at ePages, two years and a half ago in Barcelona.

Back in Barcelona I had the pleasure to work with many different and outstanding people from France, Italy, Spain and
Mexico. I had a wonderful time there, learnt lots of things and will definitely bring great memories with me for the
rest of my life. But I'm using the past tense, so it's quite obvious I no longer work at the same office.

## The decision process

At some point I decided it was the right time for me to make a career change. I had worked on the same project for quite
a while and I wanted to do something else, learn something new. However, if possible I wanted to stay at ePages and join
a different development team in Hamburg, where other projects were being worked on. Nevertheless, the process
wasn't that simple; I first had to think of all the pros and cons of relocating.

### The pros

  - **Staying at ePages.** I was happy to be part of the crew and continuing to do so in a different location definitely
  sounded good.
  - **Moving abroad.** I'd been thinking about moving abroad for many many years to live the experience of being in a
  different kind of environment.
  - **Hamburg.** Hamburg is one of the most important cities of the north of Germany and there're direct flights from
  its airport to Barcelona.
  - **Learning German.** I studied German in Spain and I want to reach a good level one day.
  - **I already knew people.** I already knew many of my colleagues and I knew I was going to feel comfortable with
  them.
  - **My personal situation.** I am young, I don't own an apartment, I'm not married and don't have children.

### The cons

  - **Leaving people behind.** Obviously I wouldn't be able to see my friends and relatives that often.
  - **Weather and food.** I know it's a classic but when you're used to experiencing good weather during most of the
  year, this is of course something to take into account. Same applies to food, I guess everyone prefers what they've
  seen at home.

### The decision

After analysing all pros and cons I realised that the former weighed more heavily than the latter and decided to ask for
a relocation. Fortunately, the company helped me with the whole process and everything was pretty straightforward.

## Life in Hamburg

It's been approximately three months since I moved to Hamburg and I don't regret it at all. I have fantastic colleagues
and team-mates, I'm doing something I like and I've been able to settle down more or less. The only annoying thing I had
to go through was lots of paperwork, but that isn't such a big deal.

One of the things I like the most about Hamburg is how green it is. Actually, there are many beautiful areas around but
my favourite one is the "Alster", which is a tributary of the "Elbe". It's near the office and sometimes after work I go
sit next to it and read a book.

Near Hamburg there's another city I can totally recommend visiting: LÃ¼beck. It has a beautiful old city and if you are a
sweet-tooth like me you need to go there and try some marzipan products - they are delicious!

## So, what now?

Well, now I'm studying German, I still have to sort out a couple of things but I'm happy to be in Hamburg and I'm
certainly looking forward to keeping earning new personal and professional experiences.
