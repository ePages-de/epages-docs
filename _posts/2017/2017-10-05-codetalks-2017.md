Recently it was about time again for popcorn, nachos and code.
Code.talks is back to Cinemaxx Dammtor after they tried Kampnagel last year.
As a result code.talks had to shrink to 1.700 people from 1.900 last year, which is still 200 people more than two years ago.

And yes - again it proved that a cinema is a pretty neat location for a software development conference.
It seems that cosy seats, popcorn, and nachos are things that most of the attendees seemed comfortable with.

Here are our highlights of this year's code.talks edition.

### 10 Tips for failing at microservices

Two years ago microservices was one of the main topics of the code.talks.
Everybody talked about it but very few actually had production experience.
Now the microservices hype cycle passed the "Peak of Inflated Expectations" and we are seeing a more realistic picture.

[David Schmitz (@koenighotze)](https://twitter.com/koenighotze) chimed in here and provided us with a very sarcastic talk about "10 Tips for failing at microservices".
It was great infotainment.
In his talk David touched many topics that are really hard to get right in a microservices context like polyglot services, build automation, shared code, domain modeling, and team collaboration and told us how to mess up.

If you liked David's talk you might think about seeing him again at the JUG Hamburg giving a talk about [painless object functional Java with Vavr](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/jug-hamburg/events/243300696/).

## Wrapping it up

Again the code.talks team did a great job organizing the conference. The talks covered what the industry is currently talking about but here and there also included topics that are not mainstream.
Eight different rooms offer a great choice but the amount of possibilities to choose from can also give you a headache.
Apart from that the Java crowd felt a little underrepresented with just four talks on the Java track.

The move back to the Cinemaxx was a good choice but the additional 200 people were problematic. Compared to 2015 there was a lot more queuing and waiting involved.

Thanks a lot to the code.talks team and see you next year!
