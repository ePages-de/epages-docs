## Intro
One of the languages that we use the most on the ePages Tools team is Ruby. We love the syntax, the simplicity and the big and active community around it. Some time ago, we wrote about our SDK for the ePages shops and lots of things have changed since then. We've kept developing it to support more operations, like data pagination, and to keep on with the releases of our colleagues from the API development team.

## Status of the sdk
We are preparing a release Soon&#8482; containing lots of model changes, in order to make the use of the gem, even easier. For example, to get the customers of our shop, we used to have to do

```ruby
  epages_shop.customers
  [<Epages::Customer:0x0000>, <Epages::Customer:0x0001>, ..., <Epages::Customer:0x0041>]
```

and then, iterate the array with all the customers. But now, you can use other parameters that the API provides, as page or the amount of results per page. So you can do things like

```ruby
  epages_shop.customers
  <Epages::CustomersResponse:0x0000
    @items = [<Epages::Customer:0x0000>, <Epages::Customer:0x0001>, ..., <Epages::Customer:0x0009>],
    @page = 1,
    @results = 42,
    @results_per_page = 10>
```

or with some parameters

```ruby
  epages_shop.customers({ page: 2, results_per_page: 10 })
  <Epages::CustomersResponse:0x0000
    @items = [<Epages::Customer:0x0010>, <Epages::Customer:0x0011>, ..., <Epages::Customer:0x0019>],
    @page = 2,
    @results = 42,
    @results_per_page = 10>
```

so you have more control on the call and it gets easier to do batch operations. We also fixed some bugs and updated some dependencies.

Testing things in the console was fun, but we needed a real life scenario to check that the gem was working correctly and to find missing features. Lucky for us, we had a task perfect for this situation, "Create an Statistics App for the ePages Appstore".
