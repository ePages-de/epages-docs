Since we develop e-commerce solutions at [ePages](https://www.epages.com/us/), there were enough techies willing to help us out when we first decided to set up a [company tech blog](https://developer.epages.com/blog) in spring 2015.
Our [API documentation](https://developer.epages.com/apps) was already [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based, so it came natural to connect our new blog to it.
The new Social Media adventure, including the [blog](https://developer.epages.com/blog) as well as a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs), started two years ago.

In the following I would like to give you some deeper insights on what we have learnt ever since we began our blog journey in order to generate relevant content for our readers and how we engaged in the developer community via Twitter.

## Where to start a new company tech blog?

Once the technical framework was set, we were ready to go.
But...where do you actually start when beginning to blog from zero?!

Well, first of all we had to consider that a company's tech blog requires thoughtful planning.
Planning your content ahead not only saves you lots of unnecessary stress when it comes to fresh content ideas, but also lets you see the big picture.
Thus, it provides you with a great overview of how to integrate different topic areas into your content structure.
For our ePages DevBlog we soon established the following topic categories:

* Tech Stories
* Working at ePages
* Events
* API
* Agile

With these categories in mind, we then developed an editorial calendar to determine what colleague would cover which topic area for which date.
Usually, we have a rough content plan for the next two months and try to publish at least four times per months.
We soon created a rotating system to make sure that our different developer teams take turns in writing blog posts.

## Define guidelines for tech blog contributors

Once you've determined the new blog's content structure, it is time to start with the creative writing process.
For a company tech blog there will probably be more than only one contributor.
Therefore, it is essential to define some basic guidelines for the blog post writers.
At ePages, there are many developers, scrum masters and other colleagues from our R&D department that deliver great blog post ideas and content.
So, for everyone to follow a similar writing and formatting pattern, we defined some blog post guidelines.
These guidelines determine issues concerning the markdown style, including layout, headings, images, code quotation rules, SEO optimization, and alike.

There is two essential elements that I would like to point out concerning content creation:
Firstly: give it a personal touch!
There is nothing worse than reading a post without a little wit and charm.
Secondly, refer to other techies and relevant blogs!
This does not only enhance your blog's credibility, but also gives you a better rating regarding search rankings.

## Tools for tracking blog performance

Now, after proof-reading your blog post and running the final tests, it is ready for publishing.
There a some very helpful tools that can analyze your blog performance.
For our ePages DevBlog, we signed up for [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) as well as connected our blog to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).
Every time a new post is published, we create a heatmap at the analytics tool Hotjar in order to track visitor numbers and to visualize reader's bounce rates.
Using Hotjar will let you learn about reading patterns and probably that readers are lazy and prefer shorter blog posts over long ones {% emoji wink %}.
Google Analytics, on the other hand, is a very powerful instrument when it comes to measuring [blog traffic](https://www.blogmutt.com/blog/measuring-blog-traffic-with-google-analytics) and analyzing your blog's performance.

## Sharing is caring: the Twitter magic

Every blog post we publish, we also share on our [ePagesDevs Twitter](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs) channel and encourage our colleagues and followers to engage in the sharing fun.
For broadening our readership, we not only tweet about our latest blog post publications but also promote articles from the archives, publish our job openings or retweet other relevant content for our followers.
Twitter is the most suitable Social Media platform when it comes to getting engaged with the developer community.

Yet, you should not underestimate the additional workload that the maintenance of a Twitter account implies.
Statistically, about [92% of companies](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/44-twitter-stats-2016/) send out a tweet more than once a day.
To engage with and keep our followers up-to-date, we tweet about *five times* per day via our [ePagesDevs account](https://twitter.com/epagesdevs) - and this even on the weekends.

## Using Twitter tools

But of course we do not work at our holy weekends {% emoji wink %}.
So, thank god for Social Media tools!
Most of our tweets are planned about a week ahead.
In oder to do so we use the planning and analytics tool [buffer](https://buffer.com/app).
When first connecting our Twitter account to buffer, it automatically calculated which time schedule would be best to maximize reaching out to and engaging with our followers.
Buffer also analyzes which posts performed best and which did not.

Tweet performance is also measured by the [Twitter Analytics](https://analytics.twitter.com) tool that comes along with setting up a Twitter account.
Twitter Analytics helps you to see, which content resonates with our audience, understand how people interact with your tweets, and to get to know your followers as well as observe the growth of your follower base.

Another tool that boosted our follower base was [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) with its function to set up [Twitter recipes](https://ifttt.com/twitter).
One recipe that was especially efficient, was the one that automatically added those people tweeting about a specific hashtag to a Twitter list.
Hence, these added people took notice of our account and were more likely to follow us.
Unfortunately, this function was removed by IFTTT as it caused some errors and problems.
Eventually, IFTTT will fix the bug and get the feature back into its repertoire.

## What are you waiting for?

A company's tech blog is a great opportunity to carry your development projects out to the public.
Also, potential job candidates can check out what you are working on and thus your company tech blog will be the perfect employer branding instrument.
And do not forget about Twitter:
Most developers are very active on Twitter!
Thus, it is basically a prerequisite in order to engage with the tech community.
