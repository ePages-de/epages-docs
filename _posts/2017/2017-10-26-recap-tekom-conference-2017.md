While the impressions of [tekom conference 2017](http://tagungen.tekom.de/h17/tekom-jahrestagung-2017/) are still fresh in my mind, I'd like to share some positive reminders with you.
I'll make it short and use some buzzwords.

## Plentiful

Legal requirements, language technologies, terminology, user experience, developer documentation, project-, team-, and cost management, professional writing, visual communication, augmented reality...
It's hard to name all of the conference topics here, but I am amazed that tekom made it possible.
Thanks for that!

## Varied

Gamification in technical documentation.
Usability engineering.
Content strategy.
Translation processes with open-source software.
Software localization.
SEO for technical writers.
Innovative employee management.
Finance for technical communicators.
Quality assurance.

I tried to browse through lots of different talks, and see what's new and what's next.
It makes me a happy TechWriter, that I'm still up to date with the latest trends in my field of work.

## Pioneering

Well, I would go even further.
ePages has just implemented one of the latest trends: a software localization tool, that our developers fell in love with.
Yay!
We're pioneers!

Also, I'm feeling confirmed that we're doing the right things when it comes to API documentation, software localization, and translation processes.
Yes, I'm a little proud {% emoji blush %}.

## Well-organized

The conference was very well organized.
I much appreciate the shuttle service from the hotel to the conference location.
The organizers ensured that check-in, changeover of speakers, as well as coffee and lunch breaks ran smoothly.
Loving it!

## Legendary

It seemed that during the last three days not a single technical documentation was published, because all TechWriters gathered together in Stuttgart {% emoji wink %}.
The tekom annual conference is still the most important event for technical writers in Germany, and even beyond.

Happy tech writing!
